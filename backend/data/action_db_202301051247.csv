Days away from lightweight bag ban,6,0,,　,https://www.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/days-away-from-lightweight-bag-ban,　,"Marking a major pivot away from single-use plastics, the NSW Government’s ban on lightweight plastic bags will come into force next week.

Minister for Environment James Griffin said the lightweight plastic bag ban is the first of many plastic items being banned in NSW this year.

“I think all of us can see the impact plastic pollution is having on our environment, which is why we’re making major changes in NSW this year,” Mr Griffin said.

“The ban on lightweight single-use bags comes into place from 1 June, and then from November, we’re banning more problematic plastics, such as cutlery and plates.

“Single-use plastic is used by many of us for just a few convenient minutes, but it remains in our environment for many years, eventually breaking into microplastics.

“Single-use plastic items and packaging make up 60 per cent of all litter in NSW. By stopping the supply of problematic plastic in the first place, we’re helping prevent it from entering our environment as litter, or going into landfill.

“We each have the power to make positive environmental change at an individual level, and I encourage everyone to choose to go plastic-free as often as they can.”

The NSW Government passed the Plastic Reduction and Circular Economy Act 2021 in November, and introduced the Plastics Action Planlaunch last year.

The ban will prevent almost 2.7 billion items of plastic litter from entering the environment in NSW over the next 20 years.

In addition to the 1 June lightweight plastic bag ban, from November the NSW Government is banning:

single-use plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery, plates, bowls and cotton buds
expanded polystyrene food ware and cups
rinse-off personal care products containing plastic microbeads.
So-called “compostable” and “bioplastic” alternatives to the above items are also being bannedlaunch. That’s because they don’t biodegrade unless they’re treated in an industrial composting facility, creating just as much of a problem as conventional plastic.",12,1,3590,Manufacturing,,

The initial program started with food waste being collected from food preparation and kitchen areas across food retail outlets on campus and residential college kitchens. In early 2021, the program expanded with the introduction of Plastic Free Dining, where a new three bin system was implemented in outdoor areas on campus to segregate waste into food waste (and compostable packaging), single-use drink containers and general waste.

This program has contributed to UNSW improving environmental outcomes by maximising recycling rates and diverting waste from landfill, through dedicated recycling streams and improved waste segregation.

Based on an independent audit of UNSW general waste (red lidded bins) around 50% of the contents can potentially be recycled into compost via a food and compostable bin program.

The index is a tool that tracks the engagement of all 5,570 Brazilian cities on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are part of the UN’s 2030 Agenda. The IDSC-BR gathers data from all the Brazilian cities and measures progress on sustainable development for each city on over 100 indicators.

The survey used to collect data makes several crossings and comparisons, building an SDG Index which ranks cities and regions. The index allows for analysis of the cities’ level of accomplishment of the 2030 Agenda in general, as well as accomplishment on each indicator it establishes. Through the release of this 2022 report, Brazil has become the first country in the world to monitor and evaluate the level of sustainability progress of all its cities towards achieving the SDGs.

“It’s a strategic instrument to public administrators, since the analysis of results allows for orientation of municipal political action, as well as defining references and goals based on administration indicators, and facilitating the monitoring of the SDGs at the local level,” explained Jorge Abrahão, General Coordinator of ICS, in the launch event held in the auditorium of the Biennial of Ibirapuera Park during the 1st Sustainable Development of Cities Forum.

 The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs emerged in 2015 as a major global pact. Signed by 193 UN member countries, including Brazil, the agreement represents a bold, common agenda to combat major economic, social, and environmental challenges. The SDGs include 17 goals and 169 indicators that require collaboration across governments, civil society and companies. “In this context, there is a big challenge to the cities. How can we implement and scale the SDGs to the local level? How can we translate the commitments defined by the UN into monitorable goals and indicators, capable of being measured and compared with the long-term, so that its evolution can be monitored and evaluated?” asked Abrahão, pointing out the IDSC-BR as a tool capable of supporting public management in this process.",11,1,3650,"Public administration and safety, Information media and telecommunications",,

In order to reduce the worst impacts of climate change, the international community has agreed that societies must limit the rise in mean global temperature to well below 2°C, as specified by the Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Meeting this goal requires that global net emissions of greenhouse gases reach zero by the year 2050. This entails a profound transformation and the deep decarbonization of our societies––a multidimensional challenge that is currently at the forefront of global dialogues and priorities. Where past diplomatic efforts have failed to achieve enough progress on climate change, regional models of problem-solving that account for both global commitments and local needs can emerge as a more effective strategy.

As cities, states, and countries across the world continue to commit to reducing their emissions, it is crucial that lessons are shared in a comprehensive and intentional manner in order to accelerate and support decarbonization planning and implementation processes.

While Sub-Saharan countries like Kenya contribute only marginally to global greenhouse gas emissions, many of them are already beginning to feel the implications of severe droughts that threaten development gains of past decades and have populations depend on humanitarian emergency supplies.","2, 15",1,3669,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing",,

Days away from lightweight bag ban,6,0,,　,https://www.nsw.gov.au/media-releases/days-away-from-lightweight-bag-ban,　,"Marking a major pivot away from single-use plastics, the NSW Government’s ban on lightweight plastic bags will come into force next week.

Minister for Environment James Griffin said the lightweight plastic bag ban is the first of many plastic items being banned in NSW this year.

“I think all of us can see the impact plastic pollution is having on our environment, which is why we’re making major changes in NSW this year,” Mr Griffin said.

“The ban on lightweight single-use bags comes into place from 1 June, and then from November, we’re banning more problematic plastics, such as cutlery and plates.

“Single-use plastic is used by many of us for just a few convenient minutes, but it remains in our environment for many years, eventually breaking into microplastics.

“Single-use plastic items and packaging make up 60 per cent of all litter in NSW. By stopping the supply of problematic plastic in the first place, we’re helping prevent it from entering our environment as litter, or going into landfill.

“We each have the power to make positive environmental change at an individual level, and I encourage everyone to choose to go plastic-free as often as they can.”

The NSW Government passed the Plastic Reduction and Circular Economy Act 2021 in November, and introduced the Plastics Action Planlaunch last year.

The ban will prevent almost 2.7 billion items of plastic litter from entering the environment in NSW over the next 20 years.

In addition to the 1 June lightweight plastic bag ban, from November the NSW Government is banning:

single-use plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery, plates, bowls and cotton buds
expanded polystyrene food ware and cups
rinse-off personal care products containing plastic microbeads.
So-called “compostable” and “bioplastic” alternatives to the above items are also being bannedlaunch. That’s because they don’t biodegrade unless they’re treated in an industrial composting facility, creating just as much of a problem as conventional plastic.",12,1,6378,,Manufacturing,

One project focusing on “leaving no LGBTQIA+ Angelenos behind” addresses the absence of LGBTQ+ communities in the SDG framework.

The students then turned their data into a set of key recommendations for the city of Los Angeles, including guidelines for gender-neutral language in official communications and recognizing the importance of intersectionality in any effort.

In 2018, Estate Management commenced a food waste program across the campus with the goal to increase the quantity of food waste recycled at UNSW and to separate food waste from general waste.

The initial program started with food waste being collected from food preparation and kitchen areas across food retail outlets on campus and residential college kitchens. In early 2021, the program expanded with the introduction of Plastic Free Dining, where a new three bin system was implemented in outdoor areas on campus to segregate waste into food waste (and compostable packaging), single-use drink containers and general waste.

This program has contributed to UNSW improving environmental outcomes by maximising recycling rates and diverting waste from landfill, through dedicated recycling streams and improved waste segregation.

Based on an independent audit of UNSW general waste (red lidded bins) around 50% of the contents can potentially be recycled into compost via a food and compostable bin program.

​Lane Cove Council switches to 100% renewable energy!,5,0,,　,https://www.lanecove.nsw.gov.au/News/Pages/RenewableEnergyAnnouncement.aspx,　,"We've made the switch! As of today, all Council facilities and street lights are now powered by 100% renewable energy!

Last year Lane Cove Council, along with 24 other participating councils, signed one of the largest renewable energy deals for local government that sees participating councils' retail electricity supplied by three NSW solar farms.

The 'switch' came into effect today which means that all Council facilities in Lane Cove, including Lane Cove Aquatic Centre, are now powered by 100% renewable energy. This, combined with Council's other energy savings and own solar power generation projects, decreases Council's emissions by 73%, a significant advance on our 80% reduction target set for 2036.

Council has budgeted to offset its vehicle fleet emissions, which pre-COVID amounted to 7.8% of Council's emissions. If these return to pre COVID levels as expected, Council will have achieved an 80% reduction in its emissions from operations.

Even without the emissions offset, from 1 July, Council's emissions from operations will be reduced from 2% to 0.5% of the LGA's total emissions.

This target outperforms the NSW Government's net zero emissions target by 2050 as well as the Net Zero Plan Stage 1: 2020–2030, to achieve 35% emissions reduction in New South Wales by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels). ","7, 13",1,6425,,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",

But when Ronni Kahn hit midlife, she found herself no longer able to turn a blind eye to her food waste problem.

Little did she know that fixing her small problem at work would lead her to unlock a hidden purpose at the very core of her inner life.

Now founder and CEO of the food rescue organisation OzHarvest, Ronni leads hundreds of staff and thousands of volunteers with the goal to nourish Australia. She serves in an advisory capacity to government and is an instrumental leader in changing federal laws to improve social justice and environmental policies.

A Repurposed Life is the story of how Ronni found her voice, her heart and her deepest calling. From her early years growing up under the brutal system of apartheid South Africa, to a socialist commune in Israel, Ronni finally settled in Australia to discover a profound new way of living.

The index is a tool that tracks the engagement of all 5,570 Brazilian cities on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are part of the UN’s 2030 Agenda. The IDSC-BR gathers data from all the Brazilian cities and measures progress on sustainable development for each city on over 100 indicators.

The survey used to collect data makes several crossings and comparisons, building an SDG Index which ranks cities and regions. The index allows for analysis of the cities’ level of accomplishment of the 2030 Agenda in general, as well as accomplishment on each indicator it establishes. Through the release of this 2022 report, Brazil has become the first country in the world to monitor and evaluate the level of sustainability progress of all its cities towards achieving the SDGs.

“It’s a strategic instrument to public administrators, since the analysis of results allows for orientation of municipal political action, as well as defining references and goals based on administration indicators, and facilitating the monitoring of the SDGs at the local level,” explained Jorge Abrahão, General Coordinator of ICS, in the launch event held in the auditorium of the Biennial of Ibirapuera Park during the 1st Sustainable Development of Cities Forum.

 The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs emerged in 2015 as a major global pact. Signed by 193 UN member countries, including Brazil, the agreement represents a bold, common agenda to combat major economic, social, and environmental challenges. The SDGs include 17 goals and 169 indicators that require collaboration across governments, civil society and companies. “In this context, there is a big challenge to the cities. How can we implement and scale the SDGs to the local level? How can we translate the commitments defined by the UN into monitorable goals and indicators, capable of being measured and compared with the long-term, so that its evolution can be monitored and evaluated?” asked Abrahão, pointing out the IDSC-BR as a tool capable of supporting public management in this process.",11,1,6438,,"Public administration and safety, Information media and telecommunications",

The SIG has emerged from a recognised need for a coordinated approach to advocacy and networking to support the access and engagement of students from refugee and asylum seeking backgrounds in post-compulsory and higher education across Australia.  It has originated from a special interest group at the Equity Practitioners in Higher Education Australasia (EPHEA) and a national symposium at the University of Newcastle, both held in November 2015, as well as regular national teleconferences exploring education pathways for young people seeking asylum and young refugees on TPVs and SHEVs hosted by the Multicultural Youth Advocacy Network (MYAN Australia) and the Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA) since November 2015. 

The group is guided by a steering committee of around 10 to 13 members, who are responsible for providing strategic direction and practical support.

In order to reduce the worst impacts of climate change, the international community has agreed that societies must limit the rise in mean global temperature to well below 2°C, as specified by the Paris Agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Meeting this goal requires that global net emissions of greenhouse gases reach zero by the year 2050. This entails a profound transformation and the deep decarbonization of our societies––a multidimensional challenge that is currently at the forefront of global dialogues and priorities. Where past diplomatic efforts have failed to achieve enough progress on climate change, regional models of problem-solving that account for both global commitments and local needs can emerge as a more effective strategy.

As cities, states, and countries across the world continue to commit to reducing their emissions, it is crucial that lessons are shared in a comprehensive and intentional manner in order to accelerate and support decarbonization planning and implementation processes. By presenting a clear vision of feasible decarbonization pathways for coordination among governments and sectors in the region of San Diego, California, the 2022 San Diego County Regional Decarbonization Framework (RDF) can help inform the establishment of other such roadmaps across the US and globally.",13,1,6455,,"Construction, Transport, postal and warehousing;Electricity, gas, water and waste services",
