","It uses the SDG framework as a most efficient way to teach two interrelated issues. On the one hand, this concerns the way that the human right to health is disparately exercised in the world and health inequities between countries may be as significant as gaps of more than 25 years in life expectancy. On the other, the SDG framework helps to demonstrate to physicians-to-be how the 2030 international agenda concerns them, not only as citizens but also as medical practitioners.","This compulsory training unit aims to ensure that every single medical student, in his or her very first semester at Medical School, learns about present-day health inequalities in the global world.","The goal of this activity is the integration of SDG3 into the professional compulsory training of every physician-to-be, so that they are aware of health inequalities worldwide.

","The University of Bristol’s ‘Sustainable Development’ open unit represents a constituent part of the innovative Bristol Futures curriculum, which is based on the provision of skills, awareness and – significantly – agency to undergraduate students at the University. Within this framework, the Sustainable Development unit has been developed by a multi-disciplinary teaching team, including academics from across the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Social Science & Law and the Faculty of Arts.","Our primary aim when developing this unit was to embed the Sustainable Development Goals – and wider sustainable development policy – into the curriculum for students across the University of Bristol. In doing so, we wanted to encourage students to both understand and embrace interdisciplinarity and systems thinking, teaching to ‘think’ beyond their disciplines, backgrounds and experience and understand that addressing global challenges requires collaboration across the traditional silos of academia and policy-making. ","Within these workshops, students have completed a number of active, problem-based tasks – including the designing of a mobile app to contribute to SDG 7, a participatory budgeting exercise centred on SDG 11 and the development of an advertising campaign to feed into SDG 12.

Integration of the SDGs in a cross-faculty interdisciplinary Masters course,"Accordingly, the SDG framework is used in a variety of ways across the Masters. Here, we highlight three specific intervention points:
1. During orientation, all new students are introduced to the SDGs. Existing students are invited to be peer mentors and share an SDG lapel pin with their mentees. This ‘anchors’ peer mentor relationships and fosters a sense of connection to cohort and the SDGs.
2. During the Masters compulsory core units ‘Perspectives on Sustainability’ and ‘Global Challenges and Sustainability’, students study the SDGs via seminars exploring the history and context of the SDGs; analysis of the Goals and Targets; deep dives into the evidence base for specific indicators; and reading academic discourse about the Goals.
3. In the advanced studies unit ‘Innovation to Influence System Change’, the SDGs inform change proposals for real-life contexts. They are used as a tool for system analysis; to support ideation; and as an evaluation tool for to examine trade-offs in change proposals.","While planning and implementing a new Cross-Faculty Master of Environment and Sustainability (MES), launched in 2017, we aimed to achieve outcomes in relation to student knowledge, perception and action for the SDGs.","Objective A above is met via prescribed activities (described above) in the compulsory core units. Evidence includes 75% of MES students in 2018 opting to focus on the SDGs for critical personal reflection.
Objective B is ensured via an integrated case-study assessment in the advanced unit. SDGs feature prominently in system analysis outcomes, reporting and problem definition, ideation, and proposals for change. Students demonstrate understanding of the SDGs strategically and practically.
Objectives C and D are more anecdotally evaluated. Peer mentoring attracts a 1:2 mentor:mentee relationship per semester – very high voluntary commitment – and the SDG ‘pins’ are popularly worn around campus.

MBAX9131: Leadership,"The course defines leadership not as a formal position of authority, but as a process of influence that delivers direction, alignment of activities towards that direction, and commitment to collective success.

 -  provide an introduction to the topic of leadership;
-  help you to build the confidence, knowledge, and skills to engage in effective leadership (including self-leadership) in a broad range of contexts;
-  invites you to become a lifelong student of leadership.
'Leadership' as a subject involves a plethora of concepts, theories, models, frameworks, and skill sets. Consequently, some other courses within the AGSM (such as Managing People and Organisations) address some dimensions of leadership. Such overlap is modest, unavoidable, and actually valuable, as future courses may provide reminders of fundamental concepts learned in this course.","The course begins by exploring principles and methods of leadership development that you can apply to build your own Leadership Development Plan during the course.

The course is an introduction to Social Impact covering fundamental concepts and key developments in what has become a complex social purpose eco-system. The course introduces an understanding of changes across what was formerly seen as a distinct social sector to examine the cross-sectoral social purpose developments that includes traditional organisational structures of Charities and Not For-Profits, Business and Government, but also new and emerging 'hybrid' structures and programs. The course will further explore how intractable social, economic and environmental problems embedded in society are being addressed through social innovation in business entrepreneurship, enterprises and cross-sector collaboration.

"COMM1100: Business
Decision Making (Corporate responsibility)","This is the first course in the Integrated First Year of the Bachelor of Commerce and offers students an introduction to business decision-making. Taking the perspective of a manager, students learn about economics, corporate responsibility, and legal principles to understand what organisational actors need to consider and what actions they might take. Fundamental economics principles inform managers to ask and answer questions about how the economy works, and how these principles influence the decisions that individuals and organisations make.  Core legal principles guide managers to protect value for owners and other stakeholders, and to protect both managers and organisations from public and private legal actions arising from their decisions.  Corporate responsibility principles direct managers to meet the organisation’s responsibilities to a range of stakeholders, and help explain why organisations may not always make the best decisions.  ","​COMM1100 is a prerequisite for COMM1150 Global Business Environments. An understanding of business decision-making is also beneficial to learn about value creation (COMM1180), how organisational resources are managed (COMM1170), and business-related problem-solving more broadly (COMM1110).","The Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) are what you should be able to demonstrate by the end of this course, if you participate fully in learning activities and successfully complete the assessment items.

"COMM1110:
Evidence-based Problem Solving (Ethical thinking)","​Effective problem solving is a core capability of a successful business professional, and UNSW Commerce students need to demonstrate problem-solving confidence and capacity in their studies and professional careers. Evidence-based Problem Solving introduces you to the fundamentals of a deliberate and structured approach to problem solving, balancing analysis and judgment, to avoid the common pitfalls of problem solving in organisations. The importance and power of evidence, and familiarity with the different sources of evidence, are critical for identifying, solving, and communicating a problem. Starting from business problems that organisations are confronted with, you will develop analytical and statistical skills as well as ethical judgement to work with different types of data and different sources of evidence to identify, solve and communicate business problems. In addition to developing an analytical mindset and new ways of working with data, you will also learn basic statistical approaches, tools, and processes to develop statistical skills required for working with data sets. You will have the opportunity to develop Excel skills for basic data analysis, interpretation, and presentation. This prepares you for working with large data sets and mastering common analytics tools in COMM1190 Data, Insights, and Decisions. This course is designed based on a problem-based learning model, in which you are presented with a problem or a problem set throughout your learning process.","COMM1110 Evidence-based Problem Solving is one of the compulsory Integrated First Year (IFY) courses of the BCom.

"COMM1150: Global Business Environments (Social
and environmental sustainability)","This course is an integral part of the Integrated First Year of your degree and builds on what you have already learned.

COMM1100 explored the fundamental decisions that managers need to make to keep the organisation running successfully and did so from the perspective of a structured environment. However, businesses do not operate in isolation: an organisation and the decisions their managers make exist in broader, often complex and dynamic environments.

COMM1150 now introduces the interplay of organisations with their environmental contexts to achieve both commercial and societal value. It prompts students to investigate global business environments with economic, legal, political, socio-cultural, ethical and sustainability lenses to sense disruptions and opportunities. This includes an understanding of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Principles of Responsible Management Education (PRME) and UNSW’s commitment to both.","​Students will become familiar with the nature and role of business in society and understand the forces that drive their strategic interactions within the global business environment. The overarching purpose of this course is to provide students with a ‘big picture’ understanding of business success.

Link to other courses: COMM1150 is the second compulsory course in the Bachelor of Commerce and builds on Business Decision Making (COMM1100).

Shoppers were encouraged to order their gifts as soon as possible or risk having packages arrive late, due to rampant supply chain disruptions and mailing delays.

Sustainability is no Longer Enough: How Corporations are Becoming the New Climate Activists,"For decades, climate activism has mainly been the domain of individuals and anti-capitalism groups. Those activists applied pressure campaigns aimed at embarrassing companies to clean up their act. But in a surprising turn of events, some companies are now among those leading the charge, becoming climate activists themselves. These companies are shifting their focus from fixing their own house to influencing public opinion and policy through climate activism and advocacy. We contend that if we are to make real progress on addressing climate change, more companies are required to do the same.

"ANTH3022 - Gender, Sexuality and Global Health","Anthropologists understand gender as the meanings that a particular society gives to the physical or biological traits that differentiate males and females. This unit will explore how cultural norms around gender and sexuality have defined, constructed, constrained, or expanded people's notions of self, their bodies, and their health in specific sociocultural contexts. The anthropological understanding of gender and sexuality, as well as health, provides a fresh lens on what appears, when viewed in terms of international politics, as 'global imperatives' - the imperative to control female sexuality and population, for example, or to categorise male and femaleness, or to control disease epidemics such as AIDS. Every one of these imperatives in fact is mediated and refracted through understandings and meanings that cling to what is most immediate and local to each of us, namely, our bodies. Anthropology understands these meanings as simultaneously symbolic, biological and existential, but the meanings are also historically and culturally specific. Gender, sexuality, and health are always mediated by the local, even as people absorb and adapt new global discourses about their sexual identity and wellbeing.",　,"1.

"ANTH3022 - Gender, Sexuality and Global Health","Anthropologists understand gender as the meanings that a particular society gives to the physical or biological traits that differentiate males and females. This unit will explore how cultural norms around gender and sexuality have defined, constructed, constrained, or expanded people's notions of self, their bodies, and their health in specific sociocultural contexts. The anthropological understanding of gender and sexuality, as well as health, provides a fresh lens on what appears, when viewed in terms of international politics, as 'global imperatives' - the imperative to control female sexuality and population, for example, or to categorise male and femaleness, or to control disease epidemics such as AIDS. Every one of these imperatives in fact is mediated and refracted through understandings and meanings that cling to what is most immediate and local to each of us, namely, our bodies. Anthropology understands these meanings as simultaneously symbolic, biological and existential, but the meanings are also historically and culturally specific. Gender, sexuality, and health are always mediated by the local, even as people absorb and adapt new global discourses about their sexual identity and wellbeing.",　,"1.

Listening for and articulating the Voice of Nature,"Most sustainability imperatives are framed anthropocentrically. Drawing from indigenous knowledge and worldviews of a kinship-based relationship with everything, and balance, we seek to reframe sustainability in terms of the ‘voice of nature’. We challenge the fundamental assertion that we have the right to use ‘resources’. If nature has a voice what is it trying to tell us?

How might our everyday lived environments best promote health and wellbeing?,"How and where we live influences health and well-being in ways that far exceed the presence of health services. The relative permanence of infrastructure like houses, roads and walkways means sound and healthy decisions can contribute to future-proofing our settlements. A particular focus in our work is asking why some population groups experience more vulnerability than others in accessing amenities. Examples are older renters seeking appropriate housing and children seeking to safely walk to and from school.

Through awareness-raising, teaching and community-based research we contribute to deepening understanding of the determinants of well-being in the contexts of everyday life. As health geographers, we collaborate with colleagues at Massey University, AUT University and the University of Alberta. This work on understanding and promoting healthy environments supports the kaupapa (or guiding principle) of good health and well-being.

Māori conceptions and contemporary environmental sciences come together to take care of NZ’s life forms and living systems,"In Māori cosmology, the world begins with a surge of energy, followed by the winds of life and growth, with all life forms and living systems linked by whakapapa (kinship). In Western creation myths, God created heaven and earth, the sun, moon and stars, and gave men and women dominion over the earth and all living creatures.

Cutting edge scientific ideas about symbiosis and complex systems and networks work well with whakapapa and draw on Enlightenment notions of a ‘tree of life’ in which all life forms are interconnected.

Work with Dr Dan Hikuroa and Professor Helen Moewaka-Barnes draws upon contemporary environmental sciences and Māori conceptions to inspire New Zealanders to care for rivers across the country, sparking a major restoration project at Longbush/Waikereru in Gisborne.

"How can we build a just, sustainable, healthy and resilient Aotearoa New Zealand?","Our Environmental Sociology course provides deep insight into the complex social processes that define, create and even threaten our natural environment, thereby empowering students to think critically and productively about our relationship with the natural environment. For example, the course illuminates economic, political and cultural factors that are contributing to Aotearoa New Zealand’s marine dead zones, degrading water systems, and biodiversity loss.

Of particular interest is the allocation of power, how it is used, and the deep ideological frameworks that contribute to the problems.

"How can we sustainably transform individuals, organisations, supply-chains, and society through systems-thinking and exponential technologies?","Sustainable transformation aspires towards balancing, integrating, and enhancing social, economic, environmental and cultural dimensions. Existing models, processes, roadmaps, frameworks and systems do not comprehensively support sustainable transformation nor do they allow decision-makers to explore interrelationships and influences between the sustainability dimensions in a holistic manner. This leads to silo-based decision-making where visions and strategies are not mapped to execution. This is true at the micro level for individuals and families and macro level for organisations, supply-chains and societies as a whole. The purpose of the research led by David Sundaram is to propose visions, values, strategies, concepts, models, processes, paradigms, frameworks, architectures, systems, roadmaps and games that will enable individuals (Claris Chung), organisations (Dr. Daud Ahmed and Dr. Gabrielle Peko), supply-chains (Dr. Hendrik Reefke) and ultimately society (Khushbu Tilvawala) to be transformed.

How can we best prepare young people to make decisions about living in sustainable ways?,"Sustainability is imperative upon quality education for all people regardless of gender or ethnicity, and education can positively impact on the many complex, interrelated issues that need to be resolved, such as inequality, poverty and environmental degradation.

The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) regards teachers as key agents of change and it is therefore critical for them to know how to teach sustainability. Education for sustainability enables learners to develop their knowledge or understandings, skills, attitudes and values so that they can make sustainable decisions about issues both personally and in collaboration with others. It involves building partnerships beyond educational institutions, including community groups and government agencies to enhance collaboration at local and regional levels. And it recognises that even young children have agency: students from early childhood through to tertiary education are not just citizens-in-waiting, rather all capable of taking action now.

Improving quality of life and health outcomes by designing non-invasive methods for managing debilitating health challenges,"One in 8 adults in New Zealand suffer from faecal incontinence and, despite the direct impact that the condition has on quality of life, access to care is limited. Our team designs tools that can be made available widely to both investigate and develop non-invasive treatment for this condition. This research has the potential to proportionally benefit sectors of society who are more frequently afflicted with incontinence.

So, while the research helps to improve health and well-being it also reduce inequalities when marginalised or minority ethnic groups are particularly afflicted. The project involves close collaboration between bioengineers and clinicians managing patients who suffer with this debilitating condition, and thereby also demonstrates the value of partnerships in contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.",　,　,Postgraduate program,New Zealand,university of Auckland,2022,"3, 4, 10, 17",Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/the-university/sustainability-and-environment/research-and-teaching-for-sustainability/faculty-of-medical-and-health-sciences/IanBissett.html,377

Why disasters have an unequal impact across society and how can we address such inequality,"Our work focuses on reducing the risk of disasters. Disasters are not extra-ordinary events. They are events that reflect how resources and power are shared within everyday society. Disasters therefore highlight structural inequalities, including challenges with gender identity, age, ethnicity, physical ability and health. We thus aim to understand the vulnerabilities and capacities of those at the margin of society who are most affected by disasters, including ethnic minorities, people with disabilities, the homeless, prisoners and children. We further develop participatory tools, especially participatory mapping and quantitative participatory methods, to foster the participation of these minority groups in reducing disaster risk.

ARCHGEN 721 : Special Topic: Designing with Resilience Thinking,"Even though resilience in the built environment is a subject of prime interest in developed and developing countries what resilience is and how to achieve it is still unclear. Designers of the built environment, like architects and landscapers, that have to deal with disturbances emerging from everyday life could benefit from the use of resilience in the urban and architectural realm. The theory behind ecological resilience offers designers the possibility of understanding the built environment as a complex adaptive system, whose change and persistence depends on its resilience. By implementing this point of view, designers could focus on analysing and developing strategies to enhance the resilience of the built environment to issues produced by the development of its own complexity. Nevertheless, this theme is often overlooked. For this reason, the present seminar wants to highlight the importance of a deeper understanding of resilience for designers. In order to achieve these goal students will be introduced to the universe of resilience thinking by reading and reviewing the original theory that produced the ideas of resilience in ecology. Moreover, students will be encouraged to produce their own contributions to the knowledge of resilience in architecture by making their own research about the subject.",　,"By the end of this course, students will be able to:

ARCHGEN 724 : Special Topic: Advanced Building Technologies,"Buildings can be more complementary designed with information from the surrounding environment. Buildings can respond to dynamics of temperature, daylight and wind ow that ultimately generate better indoor and outdoor environments. Climate change and social changes are aecting the way we conceive buildings and we are looking more and more to design solutions that are able to respond to multiple changes over time. In contemporary architecture, this response is primarily achieved through the design of the building skin, otherwise called building envelope. The implementation of the building skin with form, mass and orientation is at the basis of the design of high-performance buildings. Students will investigate how adaptive technologies and materials can be used to improve building performances without neglecting the lesson learned from the past, also understanding how this topic is developing in dierent contexts of the Asian and Oceanian side regions of the Pacic Rim.

ENVSCI 738 : Water and Society,"Experimenting with radical urban change is becoming the norm as cities around the world pursue improved futures. Experiments are considered dynamic and provisional and are seen as a way to cut through administrative red-tape and materialise visions of flourishing, sustainability and liveability. Experiments are viewed as an acceptable way to take risks and come with expectations of high failure rates but promises of high returns. But who is doing the experimenting? Who is being experimented on? Can (and should) lessons be applied elsewhere?

This course probes the appeal of experiments with more sustainable cities through a case study of Auckland’s Healthy Waterways strategy. The first half of the course examines the science of Water Sensitive Cities. Students apply and critique deterministic and constructivist approaches to realising more sustainable cities. The second half of the course attempt to makes sense of change that is produced by how improved futures are both imagined and materialised. Students examine how experiments with more sustainable cities are understood to be important. Do they reframe institutions and reconfigure actors? Do they engender radical change? Are they a viable alternative to long-term planning? Are they business-as-usual repackaged in appealing rhetoric? There are three take home messages:
1) Experiments with urban futures carry a politics like any other activity;
2) Visions of the future matter and have to be positioned among competing visions;
3) There is still need to imagine better kinds of human society. ",　,"By the end of this course, students will be able to:

Political theorists think about rights, justice, and the good life. Governments everywhere struggle with ethical problems in health. Public policy is all the better for being informed by political theory, and political theory is all the better for thinking about what ought to happen in the real world. One focus is scarcity: how should resources be allocated in a government health system? We consider organs for transplant, expensive treatments, and holding people responsible for their own health. Another focus is public health; we consider coercion to control the spread of contagious disease, and how the government should try to reduce `lifestyle’ diseases attributed to e.g. obesity.

MAORI 396 : Tikanga: Ancestral Ways,"
Nau mai, Haere mai, Piki mai ki Māori 233: Tikanga – Ancestral Ways in Modern Times

Tikanga, the customary system of values and practices that have developed over time and are deeply embedded in the social context, are dynamic and creative, constantly changing over time. During this course we will:

• explore how tikanga Māori have evolved since the first arrival of the tupuna in Aotearoa from the Pacific, and the arrival of settlers from Europe, Asia and elsewhere;

• trace historical debates among Māori and with other New Zealanders; and

• reflect upon how tikanga Māori might contribute to pathways into the future.

This is a course about experiments in the present and into the future, as well as in the past. Using a whakapapa model this course will trace topics of contemporary interest such as land use, the sea, kinship, gender relations, justice, health and economics, and explore historical debates and reflect upon possible futures. Particular focus will be on kaitiakitanga and how it is practiced.

Every effort will be made to link the course with contemporary challenges, and the interests of students with a range of interests, and to foster participatory learning.

Key subjects for discussion include:

• cosmology – visions of the world;

• tapu and noa – ancestral presence and absence;

• wānanga – experimental learning and ancestral knowledge;

• mana – leadership, governance, and ancestral power;

• tika – right ways of being, justice and law;

• utu – the principle of balance and the distribution of wealth;

• ora and mate – health, well-being and ill-being;

POLITICS 109 : Foundations of Western Politics and Law,"When we think about political issues, either in class or the wider public world, we are using and referring to a range of ideas about politics, which have been developed in the western political tradition since the ancient Greeks.  The fundamental questions we ask about politics – how should society be governed, what is justice and how should it be implemented between individuals, groups and states, where should the distinction between public and private life fall – are all questions which have been defined for us by thinkers in a historical tradition in which we are the latest participants.  The ways in which we ask and answer these questions, and what counts as relevant and important to us in doing so depend upon our own social and historical position as readers and thinkers, as well as on the ways in which these concepts have been discussed in the past.  In this course, we will focus on the relationship between individuals and the state, the meanings of justice, liberty and equality, the basis of democracy, the rights of women, and the limits to political authority and rights of resistance.",　,"By the end of this course, students will be able to:

ENVSCI 738 : Water and Society,"Experimenting with radical urban change is becoming the norm as cities around the world pursue improved futures. Experiments are considered dynamic and provisional and are seen as a way to cut through administrative red-tape and materialise visions of flourishing, sustainability and liveability. Experiments are viewed as an acceptable way to take risks and come with expectations of high failure rates but promises of high returns. But who is doing the experimenting? Who is being experimented on? Can (and should) lessons be applied elsewhere?

This course probes the appeal of experiments with more sustainable cities through a case study of Auckland’s Healthy Waterways strategy. The first half of the course examines the science of Water Sensitive Cities. Students apply and critique deterministic and constructivist approaches to realising more sustainable cities. The second half of the course attempt to makes sense of change that is produced by how improved futures are both imagined and materialised. Students examine how experiments with more sustainable cities are understood to be important. Do they reframe institutions and reconfigure actors? Do they engender radical change? Are they a viable alternative to long-term planning? Are they business-as-usual repackaged in appealing rhetoric? There are three take home messages:
1) Experiments with urban futures carry a politics like any other activity;
2) Visions of the future matter and have to be positioned among competing visions;
3) There is still need to imagine better kinds of human society. ",　,"A student who successfully completes this course will have the opportunity to design a Water Sensitive City to reveal how water scientists envision their role in social change.

SUSTAIN 200 : The Sustainable Community,"To answer these questions we will look at the basic features of group life, with a particular focus on the conditions that produce human cooperation. We'll consider the different types of human community and what fosters stability and change within complex social and ecological systems. Students will share narratives from their own cultural heritage that have helped people manage their lives together and respect ecological boundaries.

We will then look in depth at Auckland City and discuss potential innovations such as wildlife corridors, sustainable transport systems and green buildings. We will showcase examples of overseas cities that have made major progress on sustainability issues and students will learn how to hold cross-sector discussions that allow all voices to be heard when making decisions about the future.

Alongside the above, students will work in teams on a project to enhance sustainability at Waipapa Taumata Rau / The University of Auckland.  Depending on its scope and scale your project may take the form of a proposal (something that you would like to implement) or an immediate action (something that you can initiate now and potentially even begin to measure its effect). You could focus on a particular building, a process, the use of a resource/new technology, an aspect of the grounds and gardens, or an educational opportunity. With some strategic thinking, imagination, and the expertise of your group members you may even come up with something that gets implemented - or at least challenges the university community in a good way! Near the end of the semester, we'll have a session where you share your proposals with each other and sustainability experts from the university.

The second half of the course will tackle two big sustainability issues: climate change and fisheries. What is the latest science on climate change?

This section of the course aims to provide participants with an understanding of the basic economic models applied to the development, use and management of energy resources. Naturally, with energy resources vested/owned by government (i.e. the Crown) the application of economics to energy policy is particularly relevant.
Economics of Climate Change
The economics of climate change part of the course starts off with an introduction to the science and predicted temperature changes under different scenarios. After discussing the scale of the problem and the response, the course analyses integrated assessment models; different critiques of these models are discussed before considering different policy responses to move the world towards a low carbon growth path to limit temperature increases over the next century.
Electricity Markets
In this section of the course we will present models for an energy market with focus on electricity as a commodity. Energy commodities such as electricity have particular requirements, such as not being storable and having to flow over a network.

ECON 303 : Law and Economics,"This purpose of this course is to understand how economic outcomes are influenced by a nation's institutions. An important part of these institutions are legal, though they also include social, economic and political ones. We start by discussing the role of property rights in helping achieve long run economic growth. Subsequently, we study the cause of short run business cycles and how the government can mitigate them by using its legal powers to coordinate private actions on good social outcomes. The role of taxes and spending on helping reduce inequality is also examined. The relation between the ""American Dream"" and the harsh punishment of criminals is covered, as well as the different legal mechanisms for dealing with market failures. Those failures include externalities, like environmental pollution, monopolies and information asymmetries, which can collapse markets. The role of regulation and a discussion of whether its costs may exceed its benefits is an important part of the course. Finally, we take a look at the role of Corporate Social Responsibility as a non-legal way to help solve market failures. A case study of a country which appears to be prospering, namely China, yet which appears to perform weakly when it comes to the rule of law and corruption is also a focus.

POLITICS 211 : Politics of China,"With over 1.3 billion residents, China is the world’s largest country by population and home to the oldest continuous human civilization. It is the fastest growing national economy, the second largest producer of carbon emissions, the last major communist state, and accounts for more than half of all people living under authoritarian rule (about 55-60 percent). In addition to its significance for the world, China is also of pivotal importance to political scientists. Its rapid economic growth, the apparent resilience of its vanguard party, newly emerging patterns of governance, and sometimes violent forms of social mobilization have transformed China into a rich laboratory for the study of politics, one in which many long-standing theories are now being re-evaluated.
This 15 point course is designed to introduce students to the central issues, institutions, and actors in contemporary Chinese politics. Its main goal, however, is to enhance understandings of basic political science concepts and approaches, and to furnish an opportunity for students to build their analytical and writing skills, providing a foundation for more advanced studies. Students who have previously taken Politics 106, Asian 100, or Chinese 130 are qualified to enroll.
 The course comprises a series of 12 2-hour lectures, one per week over a 12-week term. These lectures are supplemented by a weekly tutorial session at which the Lecturer will lead discussions and skill-building activities related to course readings, as well as offer guidance on essay and test writing strategies. Each student is expected to write a midterm test, a critical review essay and a final exam, as well as attend and participate in all lectures and tutorial discussions.

POLITICS 254 : China and the World,"This course is about China’s foreign relations since 1978, a topic of immense importance for both China and the world. On the one hand, China’s emergence as a diplomatic and economic heavyweight is shifting the global balance of power, shaping the responses of governments and intergovernmental organizations, and posing fundamental questions about the nature of world order itself. Indeed, China’s rise is perhaps the most significant geopolitical event since the fall of the Roman Empire. On the other hand, China’s status as the world’s fastest growing economy, the leading producer of carbon emissions, and its enduring reputation as a human rights violator all make it a key country of interest for an array of governmental and non-governmental actors wishing to effect domestic changes.
The course is designed as an introduction to China’s role in international affairs, and its impact on the global economy, polity, and environment. By its end, students should have an understanding of how Chinese foreign policies are made and why they are of such global importance.

"A Poor People's Pandemic Report:
Mapping the Intersection of Poverty, Race and COVID-19","Crises do not unfold independently of the conditions from which they arise. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated preexisting social and economic disparities that have long festered in the US. Widespread and unequal distribution of wealth, income, and resources prior to the pandemic created the conditions for many of the negative outcomes associated with the virus. However, there have been glaring omissions in efforts to consistently collect and disseminate data on poverty, income, and occupation as they relate to COVID-19 outcomes. Income and wealth information are not systematically collected for people who have died or fallen ill from COVID-19 in the US; therefore, there is no systematic way to know the poverty status of those who have died.

ARTH 17410 : Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and Beyond,"This course looks at Wright’s work from multiple angles, examining his architecture and urbanism and his relationship to the built environment and socio-cultural context of his lifetime. We’ll take advantage of the celebrated Robie House on campus and of Wright’s other early work in greater Chicago; we’ll also think about his later “Usonian” houses for middle-income clients and the contextual framework he imagined for his work (“Broadacre City”), as well as his Wisconsin headquarters (Taliesin), and spectacular works like the Johnson Wax Factory, Fallingwater, and the Guggenheim Museum. By examining one architect’s work in context, students will gain experience analyzing buildings and their siting, and interpreting them in light of their complex ingredients and circumstances. In so doing, the course introduces students to thinking about architecture and urbanism in broad terms. To this end, the first half of the course is organized around a series of themes important to architecture in general (e.g., “expressing function”) and the second half examines the question of consistency and change in an individual architect’s career, including changes in design technique (e.g., ways of designing sequences of spaces and vistas) and the problem of legacy (e.g., what to do with old buildings, especially famous ones, that no longer work as originally intended).",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"3, 9, 11",Architecture and Building,Construction,https://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/classes,982

Both the physical and symbolic borders of citizenship are proliferating, with the result that border-crossings of various kinds are becoming more dangerous. This course will examine the rhetorical construction of borders in the US and other parts of the world, including Europe and South Africa, through analysis of official documents, speeches, and news accounts. The course will also consider the way that migrant rights groups, through their activism, challenge the border logic of citizenship and seek to orient an understanding of citizenship toward a global context. The major assignments for this course will include a rhetorical analysis of relevant public discourse (speeches, social media, examples of activism) related to immigration debates in the US or abroad, as well as a public online forum that will focus on immigrant rights issues.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"10, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/classes,990

As such, students encounter key case law, court opinions and commentary from leading legal scholars. They also engage with foundational texts in democratic theory, the sociology of law and organizations, and legal anthropology. Many of these readings will focus primarily on racially unequal protections under the criminal law, using significant examples drawn from Chicago. This is because criminal prosecution has been intimately tied to racial discrimination and white supremacist violence throughout the history of the United States. Now, debate is fierce around how police and prosecutors fail to protect the lives of Black people.

Hydropolitics: Water Policy and Conflict,"Water resources are increasingly contested in nearly all parts of the world. Available freshwater supplies have declined nearly 40% since 1970, and the UN predicts that, by 2025, 1.8 billion people will not have sufficient water to meet all of their daily needs. Water conflict is essentially a political problem because it reflects normative disagreements about who has the authority to define its value and appropriate uses. This course examines conflict over water and policy efforts to deal with inter-sectoral competition, international allocation, and the diplomatic and economic consequences of water resource depletion. The course begins with a discussion of water’s status as an object of policy-as property, a commodity, entitlement, and natural good. It then turns to a series of policy challenges in context including agricultural water use, allocation treaties, development disputes, and preventing humanitarian crises. No knowledge of water policy is presumed, and students will leave the course with the issue background necessary to pursue more focused research projects in water policy topics.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"6, 9, 13, 14, 15",Environmental and Related Studies,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/hydropolitics-water-policy-and-conflict/,1001

Health Impacts of Transportation Policies,"Governments invest in transport infrastructure because it encourages economic growth and mobility of people and goods, which have direct and indirect benefits to health. Yet, an excessive reliance on motorized modes of transport harms population health, the environment, and social well-being. The impact on population health is substantial: Globally, road traffic crashes kill over 1.3 million annually. Air pollution, to which transport is an important contributor, kills another 3.2 million people. Motorized modes of transport are also an important contributor to sedentary lifestyles. Physical inactivity is estimated to cause 3.2 million deaths every year, globally. This course will introduce students to thinking about transportation as a technological system that affects human health and well-being through intended and unintended mechanisms. The course will examine the complex relationship between transportation, land use, urban form, and geography, and explore how decisions in other sectors affect transportation systems, and how these in turn affect human health.

","Southern Brown Bandicoots are a Threatened Species and the site for this project, a flat 3.4-hectare ewe lambing paddock, contains the last public land population of bandicoots in the local area. Conservation desire to increase bandicoot’s range of habitat on private farms is prevented by a lack of sites where farm production and bandicoots have been proven to benefit together from predator exclusion fencing.",The aim of Basalt to Bay’s project was to use the grant funding and in-kind electric fencing to increase breeding success of Southern Brown Bandicoots in the St Helens area and to build a secure habitat for future releases of individuals from other populations.  The broader goal for this project was that the Landcare Network wanted to demonstrate to farmers that they can establish small predator proof paddocks for high value conservation AND farm assets with the same Gallagher electric fencing systems.,"The fence was constructed, using 8-Line Gallagher Westonfence and is powered by a Gallagher S400 Portable Solar Energizer. Now that the fence is up, remote cameras are stationed on it and nearby to record the wildlife response to the change of barrier between the Parks Victoria reserve and the farm – which is the boundary that sees the most wildlife pressure.",Case study,Australia,Landcarer Australia,2019,15,Natural and Physical Sciences,Professional services,https://landcareaustralia.org.au/news/baas-and-bandicoots-predator-proof-paddock/,1027

Nutrient reuse,"In Kangaroo Valley NSW, the Chittick family operate a 140 hectare dairy that produces over 2 million litres of milk each year.

At the lower end of the dairy, the effluent produced by the dairy’s 270 milking cows is managed by a pump and sump system with overflow captured by an effluent dam. The system was prone to breakdown due to the thick slurry and solid materials clogging the pump.

“I’d have to go for a swim in the effluent dam each month!” Gavin said when explaining how he fixed the breakdown of the pump.”

Understanding the system was problematic, so the Chittick family engaged a service provider to look at its efficiency and how they could improve it. The report was used as the basis for their next steps in creating a new more efficient system.

The Chittick family also wanted a system that would make better use of the effluent as a fertiliser and would provide environmental benefits for the farm and the local community.

Gavin Chittick decided to invest in a new effluent management system that would achieve these goals and so in 2019, applied for a Lion Dairy Pride Landcare Grant to assist in covering the associated costs. As a supplier to Lion, he was eligible to apply and his grant submission was successful.",　,　,Case study,Australia,Landcarer Australia,2019,"2, 6, 15",Environmental and Related Studies,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://landcareaustralia.org.au/news/nutrient-reuse/,1033
Upgrading water management systems to improve water efficiency,"Since 1999 the Mancini family have grown citrus at Tharbogang in the Riverina area of New South Wales. Operating under the name Riverbest the orchard has been supplying juicing fruit for local processors.

The orchard is set among the southerly slopes of the Macpherson Ranges with loam and sandy loam soils perfect for citrus. The Mancini family use a combination of overhead, microjet and drip irrigation systems to water 18 hectares planted to fruit trees.

Vito Mancini said the sloping land and different irrigation systems make it difficult to maintain ideal soil moisture and instead they regularly under or over water the trees. To overcome this problem, Vito decided to install soil moisture sensors across the orchard.

As a Lion orange grower, in 2019, Vito decided to apply for a Lion Orchard Pride Landcare Grant. He was successful with his application, receiving $10,000 in funding to cover the cost of the sensors.","The installation of remote soil moisture sensors allows Vito to monitor the soil to make sure he’s efficiently using water to maximise fruit productivity and quality.

He estimated that once installed and calibrated the sensors would allow him to cut water usage by 25 percent.

This water saving and the subsequent reduction in energy used to power the irrigation system would improve the orchard’s bottom line.

“Our average production is 25 tonne per hectare at a cost of $290 per tonne when you factor in water and electricity costs. By reducing our water use by 25 percent, I anticipate this cost will be brought down to $217 per tonne,” Vito said.

Vito said he also expected this will create further environmental benefits by reducing carbon emissions.

Soil Conditioning,"Michael Vecchie’s 24-hectare orchard has sandy loam soils that struggle to hold enough moisture for the trees to be their most productive. Coupled with a continuous dry season, Michael was concerned without soil improvement his orchard’s water management and productivity will be badly impacted.

The sandy loam drains water easily meaning Michael has to apply more water than a similar orchard with heavier soils that hold water better. The soil also meant his water saving measures hadn’t been as effective as he’d hoped. An example was the installation of drip irrigation to deliver water where it was needed without wastage.  However, the sandy soil made it less effective.

To overcome his problematic soils and to increase his orchard’s productivity while cutting the amount of water needed Michael decided to improve his soils. To achieve this, though he needed to purchase machinery that could improve the soils.

As a Lion orange supplier, in early 2019, Michael applied for a Lion Orchard Pride Landcare Grant.  He was successful in receiving a grant for $10,000 which enabled him to fund his project.","After consulting with his local agronomist and doing some research on what soil conditioning would best suit his orchard, Michael decided on the best way forward.

He planned to spread manure and compost to improve the topsoil which in turn would increase the organic matter in the soil. This organic matter would encourage microorganisms that hold moisture and lift the nutrients available to the fruit trees.

In addition, Michael planned to mulch around the trees to improve the health of the trees, cut down on weeds, and help the soil keep its moisture.

The end goal, Michael said, was to maximise the water used, to improve the health of his fruit trees and to make more nutrients available to them in order to lift productivity.

The conditioned soils would also improve the quality of the fruit crop, which would benefit his operation.",　,Case study,Australia,Landcarer Australia,2019,"2, 9",Natural and Physical Sciences,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing",https://landcareaustralia.org.au/news/soil-conditioning/,1035
Minko North Solar,"Michael Boerema operates the Minko North dairy in Korunye South Australia. Spread over 80 hectares, Michael manages a 360 head cow herd housed in an undercover feed pad and milkshed which operates a 50-stand rotary.

The dairy is also used as a training facility by the University of Adelaide. This connection keeps Michael in the loop with new technology, nutrition and animal husbandry techniques.

Concerned by increasing electricity costs and emissions produced by the operation, Michael decided to look for alternative energy sources that could make use of the region’s abundant sunshine. He worked with Dairy Australia whose energy audit gave Michael the business case needed to confidently invest in solar panels to partly supply the energy needed to run the shed.

Finding out about the Lion Dairy Pride Landcare Grants, Michael successfully applied for a grant to partially fund the cost of the panels.  ","Once the benefits had been identified the next step was to install the solar panels on the dairy shed. In total, Michael planned to install 30 KWH of Solenergy panels that he estimated would cut the operation’s reliance on an energy provider by 20,555 KWH and reduce its carbon emissions by 10.9 tons annually.

Protecting natural creeks from cattle grazing,"In Waterloo Western Australia, Warrick Tyrrell operates a 120-hectare dairy with a herd of 300 to 330 milking cows who produce 2.5 million litres of milk each year. A quarter of the property is under irrigation supplying part of the feed base over summer.
The cattle water at a creek that runs through the property, however this comes at an environmental cost as the banks have become degraded risking water quality and salinity. Realising he couldn’t continue to use the creek as a water source, Warrick decided to fence it off, replant the banks with native trees and install water troughs.","Warrick said the project included the installation of a solar water pump and a tank to provide livestock with water. To stop erosion and stabilise the banks the creek needed to be fenced off and planted with trees that would provide the additional benefit of cutting down salinity.

By fencing off the creek, Warrick could continue to graze cattle on pastures near the creek without damaging it.

Over time Warrick expects the health of the creek and the land around it will be improved making the operation more sustainable. On top of these benefits the use of solar to power the water pump means no additional emissions will be generated and the native trees will encourage and support more native wildlife that’s found on the property.",　,Case study,Australia,Landcarer Australia,2019,6,Environmental and Related Studies,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing",https://landcareaustralia.org.au/news/protecting-natural-creeks-from-cattle-grazing/,1037
Effluent reuse system,"For 100 years the Henry family have operated a dairy farm near Hodgsonvale a town located in the scenic Queensland Darling Downs. Matt Henry continues the family tradition maintaining a 150 head dairy herd.

As part of the dairy shed maintenance, Matt hoses the yards and equipment, however this requires 6,000 litres of fresh water every day. This is a significant amount of water, particularly in the dry season.

To cut down on his daily use of fresh water Matt decided to install an effluent pump in the pond to capture waste and create a source of recycled water.

As a supplier to Lion Dairy supplier, Matt applied for and was successful in obtaining a 2019 Lion Dairy Pride Landcare Grant that provided partial funding for the investment required.  ","Before work could begin, Matt engaged contractors to survey the land in order to work out what pump would be able to efficiently move the effluent from the nearby pond to the dairy. This was achieved by measuring the distance between the pond and the dairy as well as the rate of fall.

Once installed the effluent pump would be able to recycle water that was safe to hose down the yard and dairy platform. Matt said he expected once operational the effluent pump would cut his daily water use to 3,500 litres or 60 percent.

Underground main to increase area for effluent application,"Nestled in Queensland’s Atherton Tablelands James and Sari Geraghty operate a 250 head dairy farm producing 1.6 million litres of milk each year.
The 1350-acre property is set among the region’s pristine environment. Concerned their existing dairy effluent system could contaminate the ground water and overload the soil with nutrients, James and Sari decided to upgrade to a system that would better manage the waste.","The Geraghty’s had used the dairy effluent to fertilise 3.5 hectares of the property but worked out if they installed 500 metres of underground pipes this could be expanded by an additional 8.5 hectares without overloading the soil or risking ground water contamination.

As well as the additional land that could be fertilised, the pipes were a more efficient way to spread the waste and could also irrigate the pastures to improve production particularly during dry seasons.

By using the effluent over a larger area, the dairy would reduce its need for chemical fertiliser and would also prevent nutrient overload as the same quantity is spread further. This would also reduce the risk of the property’s creeks and ground water being contaminated which was especially important as runoff could spill into the nearby country and waterways.

The work on the pipeline began in August 2019 and was completed within a few months. The system is made up of a network of pipes and outlet and inlet hydrants to move the waste from the dairy to the pasture. Taking a whole farm approach, James and Sari also addressed a section of laneway in a gully that became muddy and eroded as cattle walked along the laneway risking contamination of the nearby creek. To address it they recapped the lane and installed a drainage pipe underneath it.

A sediment dam that captures runoff from nearby paddocks and the laneway was cleaned to prevent it contaminating the nearby creek.

When talking about the project James said they had researched and planned for the system that would best work for their property, but it wasn’t without setbacks.

In 2018, they were updating to a rotary dairy in order to increase herd numbers in the coming years.

With this increase in herd numbers and the farm’s effluent system already at capacity, the Fitzgeralds needed to upgrade and update the system.  This would ensure all water is captured from the new diary and renovated yards.","In 2018, Anna was successful with her application for an a2™ Sustainable Agriculture Landcare Grant in the amount of $25,000 to help fund the farm’s effluent upgrade project.

The project aims were to partially relocate and update the effluent system to ensure that the farm met environmental best practice. The liquid holding pond was particularly undersized and required frequent emptying.  This meant that they were irrigating paddocks in the winter when they did not have to just to use the water supplied.

Reducing orchard emissions while cutting electricity bills,"Neil and Lynda Boardman operate a 100-acre orchard where they produce oranges for juicing. Spread over two sites, on a property located near Leeton in the NSW Riverina, the orchard is irrigated to ensure the trees are adequately watered to produce fruit.

With electricity bills getting higher, Lynda and Neil altered the time they irrigated to take advantage of off-peak power. This was problematic as the irrigation system would run at night making it impossible to see when and where a pipe had burst or if there were leaks in the line.

Recognising irrigation during off-peak wasn’t a long-term solution, they looked at alternatives to their existing energy supply. After talking to other orchardists and doing research, Lynda and Neil decided the best solution would be to install solar panels to power the water pumps at the two sites.

They estimated the solar panels would cut their electricity bills by tapping into the abundant sunshine in the area, and at the same time provide an environmental benefit by reducing the orchard’s emissions.

For several years, Lion has funded Lion Dairy Pride Landcare Grants for dairy farmers and in 2018 added the Lion Orchard Pride Landcare Grants program.

"Introduction to Critical Spatial Media: Visualizing Urban, Environmental, and Planetary Change","This course introduces critical theories and techniques for visualizing interconnected transformations of urban, environmental, and planetary systems amidst the pressures of climate change, urbanization, and global economies of capitalism. Weekly lectures will introduce major themes and theoretical debates, paired with hands-on lab tutorials exploring a selection of methods in conventional and experimental geographic visualization. Thematically, the course will be organized around critical interpretations of the Anthropocene, a concept designating the epoch in which anthropogenic activities are recognized as the dominant force of planetary climatic and ecological change. We will present these interpretations through modules structured around different conceptual paradigms and alternative epochal designations (e.g. the Urbanocene, the Capitalocene, the Plantationocene). Through weekly lab exercises and a final, synthetic project, the course will move from critically analyzing prevalent theoretical frameworks, geospatial data, and associated visualization techniques to creatively visualizing critical alternatives. Students will learn how to construct visual narratives through a variety of spatial media (e.g. maps, diagrams, visual timelines), scales (e.g. bodies, neighborhoods, landscapes, the planetary), and techniques/platforms (e.g. GIS, web mapping, basic programming language tools, and vector/raster visualization programs).",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"11, 13",Information Technology,Information media and telecommunications,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/introduction-to-critical-spatial-media-visualizing-urban-environmental-and-planetary-change/,1059

Urban Innovation: Cultural Place Making and Scenescapes,"Activists from Balzac, Jane Jacobs, and others today seek to change the world using the arts. Ignored by most social science theories, these new cultural initiatives and policies are increasing globally. Urban planning and architecture policies, walking and parades, posters and demonstrations, new coffee shops and storefront churches reinforce selective development of specific cities and neighborhoods. These transform our everyday social environments into new types of scenes. They factor into crucial decisions, about where to work, to open a business, to found a political activist group, to live, what political causes to support, and more. The course reviews new case studies and comparative analyses from China to Chicago to Poland that detail these processes.

Indigenous Rights and Capitalism,"Over the past decades Indigenous rights have been codified in international law, transforming the relationship between political activism, legal claims, and market forces. For Indigenous peoples, legal rights have produced formal structures for political recognition and mechanisms for raising territorial claims, but they have not resolved the problems of sovereignty and self-determination. They have, however, raised questions around if, how, and on what terms to engage with capital. In this course, we will explore different answers to these questions. We will examine how Indigenous groups, movements, and organizations navigate state and corporate power; why they choose (or are compelled) to embrace or resist capitalist relations; and how this conjuncture shapes radical projects that seek to break with the imperatives of profit, competition, and growth. By critically studying how rights shape larger economic processes and ideologies, we will ask whether legal rights advance Indigenous political struggles or reinforce colonial domination.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"10, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/indigenous-rights-and-capitalism/,1065
Techno-Ecology: The Social Life of Infrastructure,"Infrastructure reemerges as a heated political topic in the United States against the background of the new great power competition in the world and the increasing concern of inequality and social justice at home. Such divergent political interests illuminate the tension between the promises of infrastructure and the challenges it poses. What is infrastructure? And why does it matter? This course takes infrastructure as its object of inquiry and explores ways of building and using infrastructure in various historical and social settings. A burgeoning scholarship on infrastructure reflects on the complexity of infrastructure’s environmental, political, social, and economic impact. Infrastructure was a critical part of both empire building and nation-state development. At the same time, massive infrastructure projects could also bring about self-defeating debacles that threatened the very regimes who had implemented them. Infrastructure has elevated millions from poverty and provided more with necessity and convenience. But it also creates barriers, destroys ecological systems, and materialized discrimination. The challenges of climate change and cyber security urges us to rethink infrastructure through the lens of scale, distribution, and trust. This course aims to complicate any monolithic conceptualizations of development, and to rethink the relations between us-at the levels of individual, communal and global-with the techno-ecology called infrastructure.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"9, 11, 13, 14, 15",Environmental and Related Studies,Public administration and safety,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/techno-ecology-the-social-life-of-infrastructure/,1066
"Tutorial: Toxic America: Pollutants, Poisons, Politics","Exposure to toxic substances is a routine condition of life in the United States. If toxics represent “adverse effects” to living systems, how and why did they become so abundant in the air, water, and food we ingest? The premise of this course is that the twentieth century witnessed soaring levels of toxic pollution. As synthetic chemicals, agricultural dusts, antibiotic residues, radioactive isotopes, and heavy metals saturated our environments, American scientists, activists, and artists identified and politicized lists of poisons. Students will first learn about the history of toxicology and environmental health in the US. We will then work with these frameworks to examine toxic events and everyday exposures as forms of fallout. We will investigate how the distribution of toxics reflects the racial, gender, and settler-colonial histories of America. We will explore history through an understanding that risk and exposure are central to environmental justice. A final concern is to consider how invisible, microscopic, and nonhuman living things inform our historical methods and questions.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"3, 6, 10",Environmental and Related Studies,Public administration and safety,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/tutorial-toxic-america-pollutants-poisons-politics/,1067
The Bible and Ecology,"In 2010, HarperCollins published The Green Bible, which claims to help readers “understand the Bible’s powerful message for the earth.” What precisely is the Bible’s “message for the earth”? Does the Bible even contain one unified message about the relationship between God, human beings, and the natural world? For many, the question of “what the Bible says” about the environment has become urgent in the midst of the intersecting environmental crises of our day, from global warming to the sixth mass extinction. And yet, there does not seem to be an easy answer to this question; the Bible has been used both to support ethics of conservation and to justify exploitation of the earth’s resources. In this course, we will analyze key passages employed in contemporary discourse about the Bible and the environment from a historical-critical perspective. At the same time, we will investigate how these texts are being invoked today in support of various agendas. Along the way, we will discover and interrogate the profound influence of biblical cosmologies, anthropologies, and eschatologies in shaping attitudes towards the earth and its nonhuman inhabitants.

Experimental Futures: Re-figurations of Human/Environment Relationships,"The naming of the current era after the human-Anthropocene-is widely criticized. Scholars such as Donna Haraway bemoan the emphasis on the human being and its control over earthly matters at a moment when non-human entanglements with the world are simultaneously overlooked. Other thinkers point out that the planetary changes of the Anthropocene have occurred mainly due to capitalism and industrialization. In the course of these debates, the role of the human and the understanding of the human as part of the Earth’s ecosystem is discussed again and again. Especially in the arts and design, new figurations of the human and a future outside anthropocentrism are being developed. This course follows fundamental questions around the emergence of this discourse: Which tropes, materials, and concepts do we collectively use to imagine our future? Who gets to participate in these imaginaries and who is thereby excluded? What role do the arts and design play in this process? In this class, students will gain understanding of an emerging area of interdisciplinary research that reframes the category of the “human” in face of contemporary environmental challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity.

"Toxics, Toxic Torts and Environmental Injustice","(CORE, WP) This course will expose students to common law and administrative approaches for addressing actual and potential public health and environmental harms from toxic substances. The course will begin by examining concepts of risk assessment and risk management. Next, the course will look at common law approaches, including theories of liability, causation, admissibility of evidence, proximate cause, damages, and defenses. The course will then review in-depth federal laws to address these issues, such as statutes that cover solid and hazardous waste (RCRA and CERCLA (Superfund)) and potentially toxic products (FIFRA, TSCA). Throughout the course, students will learn about how individuals and groups, including low-income and people-of-color communities, have sought redress for the toxic exposures they have faced. The course is a complement to Professor Kim’s Environmental Law: Air, Water, and Animals course; neither is a prerequisite for the other, and the two share little overlap.

Writing Persuasion: Health and Environment,"A writing-intensive course in persuasive techniques that influence opinions and attempt to change behavior. This year our focus will be on an issue that presents a challenge for persuasion theory: the environment. People are notoriously slow to change their beliefs and behavior on environmental issues, and persuasion theory suggests reasons why this might be the case. Environmental problems ask readers to weigh costs that affect one group against benefits that might accrue to someone else. They involve time frames ranging from moments (which are easy to think and write about) to millennia (not so easy) to geological epochs, a time scale so remote from our experience as to be opaque to the imagination. Environmental problems are complex in ways that make them difficult to capture in a coherent, emotionally compelling narrative. Many individually innocuous and seemingly unrelated environmental events can converge over time to produce consequences that are counter-intuitively larger and graver than their causes. This felt disparity between actions and outcomes can violate an audience’s sense of fairness, biasing the audience against a persuasive appeal.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"3, 13",Environmental and Related Studies,Health care and social assistance,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/writing-persuasion-health-and-environment/,1094
Brauer Seminar: Theology of Nature and Nature of Theology,"This Brauer seminar will explore historical, ethical, legal and theological conceptions of “nature” and extrapolating from these reflect on the “nature of theological reflection” and so connect the various meanings of the seminar’s title. The question of nature-human and non-human-is hotly debated today. This is true in the face of the global environmental crisis but no less so in important matters brought before the Supreme Court, which might lead to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade or the undoing of same-sex marriage and are often grounded in appeals to “nature” and the natural. The topic has occupied thinkers throughout Western history ranging from natural law ethics, moral naturalism, definitions of the existence and essence of God and, for Christians, the “nature”, i.e., hypostatic union of the Christ, questions about creation and the natural order, and the possibility and task of natural theology. Even current questions about transhumanism and posthumanism find historical forerunners in ideas about theosis or divinization of human nature as well as in debates about resurrection and the possibility of mystical self-transcendence. Each of these topics implies something about nature and also about the nature and task of theological thinking. The seminar will explore these matters with a focus on and shifting understanding of human and divine nature, sustained throughout by a deep interest in the question of “natural religion,” “natural law,” and “natural theology.”",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2022,"5, 10, 11",Humanities and Law,Arts and recreation services,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/brauer-seminar-theology-of-nature-and-nature-of-theology/,1095

From Chekhov to Chernobyl: Russian Literature of Environmental Catastrophe,"What is it that made the fact of anthropogenic climate change “unthinkable” in the 20th century, and what ideas might allow us to think past what Amitav Ghosh calls this “great derangement”? Environmental degradation and disaster provide a steady backdrop to the 20th century in Russia and the Soviet Union. With control over one sixth of the world’s land mass, the Russian and Soviet Empires exploited the seemingly inexhaustible natural resources of the country’s territory via industrialization, collectivization, forced migration and a vast system of prison camps and internal exile. While the Soviet regime promised mastery over nature, and Russian culture valorized the harmonization of humans with the natural world, environmental catastrophe, both sudden and cumulative, proved the folly of those dreams. Though the Soviet narrative of unflagging progress towards an industrialized utopia rendered these follies unmentionable, imaginative literature provides an indelible record of their costs. We will read works by authors who have grappled with this ongoing catastrophe and its implications for relations between human beings and the world. How might the cultural legacies of communism reframe some of the most vital questions for our shared planetary future? We will examine the ecological thinking of writers and filmmakers including Anton Chekhov, Vladimir Vernadsky, Andrey Platonov, Valentin Rasputin, Larisa Shepitko, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Svetlana Alexievich.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2021,"7, 9, 13, 14, 15",Creative Arts,Arts and recreation services,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/from-chekhov-to-chernobyl-russian-literature-of-environmental-catastrophe/,1101

Urban Ecology in the Great Nearby,"Places like the Great Barrier Reef, Great Smoky Mountains, or Great Outdoors elicit ideas of a nature that is far away and often presumed to be “pristine.” Not only are these presumptions worthy of interrogation, but they may limit our understanding of the natural world that is in close proximity to humans. In this course students will use our restricted geographical movement during a pandemic as an opportunity to focus on hyperlocal urban ecology: that of the Great Nearby. What can we learn about our neighborhood and its human and non-human residents through close observation in a finite geographic area? What are the benefits, scientifically and socially, of understanding the Great Nearby? What are the challenges of place-based ecology, especially in scaling up to make regional and global connections? Using an ecological lens to investigate the urban landscape up close, students will learn the importance of observation as it relates to forming hypotheses to understand the world, as well as revealing the urban natural world that we may not have noticed before. Grounded in the rigor of urban ecology, place-based research, long-term monitoring, and their application, students are expected to be actively outdoors in their local urban environment throughout the quarter.",　,　,Course,United States,University of Chicago ,2021,11,Environmental and Related Studies,Professional services,https://epic.uchicago.edu/opportunities/urban-ecology-in-the-great-nearby/,1105
Farms as Factories: Industrial Ideals in ‘Modern’ Agriculture,"Plants and animals are now produced in capital-intensive, factory-like settings. The industrialization of agriculture has not only transformed what we eat, but also the ecology of the globe and biology of its inhabitants. This course explores the logics, history, and consequences of an agricultural sector that simultaneously generates lagoons of pig manure, proprietary DNA, and monocropped landscapes. How does commoditizing wheat alter its value? How do pigs to change when they live their lives on concrete? What forms of care are needed to keep antibiotic-laden chickens alive? How does the industrial production of life rearrange ‘modern’ concepts of nature? The course situates these questions within a broader framework of capitalism and commoditization; we begin by studying the rationale of proto-industrial production on slave plantations, consider the results of agricultural ‘modernization’ in the 19th and 20th centuries, and analyze how social scientists have studied these processes. Then, we examine how agricultural products – plants and animals – have been physically altered to facilitate standardized production, and study how these shifts have changed the role of workers and social milieu of agrarian labor.

F&ES 609 Advanced Seminar on Industrial Ecology: Waste Management and the Circular Economy,"Diversion of waste from disposal has been a long-standing issue in environmental policy and management. It has gained renewed salience as the notion of the circular economy (CE) has captured the imagination of policy makers, business leaders, and environmental advocates around the world. The CE has also been challenged as to its environmental goals, scientific foundations, and economic feasibility. In a circular economy, resources are kept in circulation for as long as possible, the maximum value is extracted from them while in use, and products and materials are recovered at end of life for continued productive usage. The core conception of closing material cycles and key strategies in the circular economy—reduction, reuse, recycling, extension of product lifespans, product-service systems, systems analysis—have been proposed and examined for more than two decades in industrial ecology. This seminar will start with an introduction to solid waste management systems as they exist in developed countries. In the second half of the semester, the seminar will explore the environmental and resource premises and possibilities of the circular economy through examination of the core literature followed by a deeper dive into several elements of the CE. The goal of this 3-credit seminar is twofold: (1) to develop a sophisticated understanding of the circular economy in order to assess its potential in contributing to sustainability and (2) to apply the concepts and methods of industrial ecology",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2019,"6, 9, 13",Engineering and Related Technologies,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=201903&crn=14331,1207

Furthermore, rapid population growth is straining the capacity of cities to provide essential goods and basic services such as electricity, drinking water, sewage, and trash removal, as well as provide a reliable transportation infrastructure. Can autonomous cars, buses and taxis help solve this? Can sensors tracking water usage and trash levels help create incentives for city dwellers to consume less and conserve more? Can cameras tracking pedestrian and traffic patterns help reduce congestion and pollution? We will discuss many questions in our synopsis of numerous global cities. We will discuss the proliferation of onnectivity via sensors and computing; the public policies influencing connected cities; the social forces doing the same; and, what this all means for the next chapter of humankind development.

F&ES 816 Electric Utilities: An Industry in Transition,"The U.S. electric utility industry is a $370 billion business with capital expenditures on the order of $100 billion per year to replace aging infrastructure, implement new technologies, and meet new regulatory requirements. A reliable electricity infrastructure is essential for the U.S. economy and the health and safety of its citizens. The electric industry also has a significant impact on the environment. In the United States, electric power generation is responsible for about 40 percent of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. Electric utilities in the United States are at a crossroads. Technological innovations, improving economics, and regulatory incentives provide a transformational opportunity to implement demand-side resources and distributed energy technologies that will both lower emissions and improve service to customers. Such significant changes could, however, disrupt existing utility business models and therefore may not be fully supported by incumbent utilities. This course focuses on the issues, challenges, risks, and trade-offs associated with moving the U.S. utility industry toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future.

GLBL 366 Politics of Global Health,"Interest in and attention to global health has expanded considerably in recent years. Public and private sector investments in solving global health challenges are increasing. Many of the challenges to solving global health problems though are not only in the resources required to close existing gaps. Politics, policy and power are dominant in the global health sphere. Understanding these dynamics is essential to helping to tackle the world’s greatest global health challenges. This course examines the intricate and diverse politics of global health and how they shape our inclination, ability, and direction of response to global health challenges. We explore the historical and current day power dynamics affecting health burdens, and which actually have effects on the health system’s ability to care for a population. We explore the principle actors in the global health space, and how they are governed. Discussions also consider how health intersects with economics, national security, the law and regulation, climate change and conflict. Finally we explore the power dynamics within “ourselves” and how health is valued on a personal level through examination of specific countries health systems; we explore how countries have embraced health as a right (or not)  and designed their health systems to care for their complete populations (or not).",　,　,UnderPostgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2020,3,Health,Health care and social assistance,https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202003&crn=15459,1283

Topics of discussion include colonialism, development, resource extraction, globalization, ecological degradation, nonhuman agency, and indigenous cosmologies. The course is concerned with the narrative strategies affording the illumination of environmental ideas. We begin by engaging with the questions of postcolonial and world literature and return to these throughout the semester as we read the primary texts, drawn from Africa, the Caribbean, and Asia. We consider African ecologies in their complexity from colonial through post-colonial times. In the unit on the Caribbean, we take up the transformations of the landscape from slavery, through colonialism, and the contemporary era. Turning to Asian spaces, the seminar explores changes brought about by modernity and globalization as well as the effects on both humans and nonhumans.

Consideration is given to formal as well as operational prescriptions and practice with regard to the participants in this system (states, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, political parties, pressure groups, multinational enterprises, other private associations, private armies and gangs, and individuals); the formal and informal arenas of interaction; the allocation of control over and regulation of the resources of the planet; the protection of people and the regulation of nationality; and the allocation among states of jurisdiction to make and apply law. In contrast to more traditional approaches, which try to ignore the role of power in this system, that role will be candidly acknowledged, and the problems and opportunities it presents will be explored. Special attention is given to (1) theory; (2) the establishment, transformation, and termination of actors; (3) control of access to and regulation of resources, including environmental prescriptions; (4) nationality and human rights; and (5) the regulation of armed conflict.

F&ES 980 Social Justice in the Global Food System Capstone,"This course explores social justice dimensions of today’s globalized food system, considering justice in terms of sociopolitical and environmental dynamics. We connect theory and practice through work with community-based organizations working at the nexus of food, agriculture, and social justice. The capstone project work is grounded in food and social justice concepts examined through course materials and seminar discussions. We examine how governmental environmental strategies affect social equity in the food system at multiple scales. We discuss how land grabbing or food insecurity is connected to relative power on the global stage. We consider how phenomena such as structural violence and neoliberalization surface within the food system, and what this means for sustainability and justice—in urban and rural settings. We examine and debate concepts and practices including food sovereignty, agroecology, black agrarianism, and the right to food used to advance positive change. Through the capstone project, students have the opportunity to deepen learning and contribute to the work of community groups forging pathways for equity and justice in the food system, particularly among communities historically marginalized from mainstream economies and policy making. Project work includes meetings with organizational leaders to understand context and co-develop appropriate project approaches. Students work in groups to conduct in-depth research and analysis, and engage in additional professional and educational activities connected to the project. Student groups prepare a final presentation and report to be shared with the partner organizations. The course provides opportunities to develop competencies in analyzing global food system phenomena through social justice frameworks, and working within diverse settings on food and social justice issues, as practice for management, policy making, and other professional roles.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2019,"2, 10, 16, 17",Humanities and Law,Manufacturing,https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=201903&crn=13810,1292

F&ES 831 Society and Natural Resources,"This research seminar explores the relationship between society and natural resources in a genuinely interdisciplinary manner (explicit, systematic, contextual, using a comprehensive meta-framework). This fall’s session is a “reflexive conversation” about the problematic situation in which we all now find ourselves. We live in a time of growing uncertainty and mounting problems. This situation can be best understood as constituting a “reflexive moment.” The reflexive moment encourages a reconsideration of past developments and future possibilities (personal to global). We want to find the best way to understand ourselves (personally and professionally) in the current and foreseeable problematic situation (local to global, immediate to multi-decade). We should never forget that we share the planet with millions of other forms of life. We want to find ways to mobilize our knowledge and practice to help fellow humans live fulfilling lives (justice) and address real-world challenges on varying scales (environmental health). The question before us: Can we come to some clarity about this reflexive moment, our growing problems (environmental and social), and the myriad relationships involved? We discuss these and many other matters, seeking clarity, a foundation, and direction for ourselves, work, and lives.

ARCH 4213 The City and Carbon Modernity,"Humanity has moved through three energy paradigms, each of which has produced different built environments and social organizations. At each transition—from nomadic to agricultural and from agricultural to industrial—the productive capacity of human society was transformed, restructuring the existing social order and engendering a corresponding spatial and architectural paradigm. This course studies our current energy paradigm—carbon-intensive fossil fuels—as a driver of urban and architectural form. Rather than studying the technical aspects of energy, however, the course focuses on the social and spatial organizations that arise and are dependent on dense and abundant energy, identifying these as carbon form. Despite increasing awareness of environmental issues, architects continue to replicate carbon form, preventing a transition out of our current energy paradigm. Just as the modern movement proposed a new organization for the city based on the realities of industry, this moment demands new organizations that can respond to an urban system that the climate crisis has shown to be obsolete. Unlike in modernism, however, the energy transition to which we must respond has not yet occurred. And yet, architecture must still declare the death of carbon modernity and seek the means to overcome its material and cultural legacy. In this light, the course interrogates the foundations of contemporary human organization in order to lay new foundations for the oncoming transitions in energy and social form. Students study the theoretical roots of carbon form in the works of Le Corbusier, Hilberseimer, Koolhaas, and others, and speculate on new human settlement patterns by examining the relationship between the energy grid and the urban grid, i.e., between energy and urban form. Assignments include readings, reading responses, as well as drawings at the midterm and final.

AMST 479 The Displaced: Migrant and Refugee Narratives of the 20th and 21st Centuries,"This course examines a series of transnational literary texts and films that illuminate how the displaced—migrants, exiles, and refugees— remake home away from their native countries. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have produced massive displacements due to wars, genocides, racial, ethnic and religious conflicts, economic and climate change, among other factors. Our course focuses on several texts that explore questions of home, nation, and self in the context of specific historical events such as the Holocaust, civil rights movements in the U.S., internment, the Indian partition, African decolonization, and Middle Eastern/Arab ethno-religious conflicts and wars. We examine these events alongside the shifting legal and political policies and categories related to asylum, humanitarian parole, refugee, and illegal alien status. Exploring themes such as nostalgia, longing, trauma, and memory, we look at the possibilities and limitations of creating, contesting, and imagining home in the diaspora. Our objective is to debate and develop the ethical, political, geographic, and imaginative articulations of home in an era of mass displacements and geo-political crises.

E&EB 035 The Ecology of Food,"Food and ecology are inextricably linked, both in the production of domesticated food through agriculture and livestock, and in the harvesting of wild plants and animals.  Furthermore, the production and consumption of food has downstream consequences through energy consumption, food waste, trophic interactions and the transportation of food around the globe. These topics link to many of the fundamental concepts of ecology, including population biology, the niche, trophic interactions, nitrogen cycling and the effects on biodiversity. In this class we explore each of these topics intensively through a combination of lectures, readings and interactive field trips to on/near campus ecosystems, the Marsh Botanical Gardens and the Yale Sustainable Farm. Each week, we meet twice for 50 minutes for a combination of lecture and discussion (online – ZOOM), and for 110 minutes for field trips, discussions, and guest lectures.

F&ES 724 Watershed Cycles and Processes,"Everyone lives in a watershed, an area of land that funnels rainfall and snowmelt to a stream, river, lake, or section of coastline. F&ES 724 examines watershed processes that affect, or are affected by, the stocks, flows, and quality of freshwater. It also surveys challenges faced by watershed managers, while emphasizing the science that informs their choices. By drawing from the fields of hydrology, ecology, and chemistry, the course begins by investigating cycles that govern the fates of water, nutrients, carbon, and pollutants within watersheds. This basic knowledge underpins watershed management decisions that are, for example, intended to safeguard drinking-water quality, ensure sustainable freshwater consumption, and preserve ecosystem services that depend on healthy riparian corridors.  In coordination with treatments of watershed functions, FES 724 explores the impacts of  anthropogenic stresses on freshwater flows, water quality, and the ecology of sensitive watershed ecosystems. The course also covers measurements, models, and other tools used in watershed assessment and case studies of science-based watershed planning and adaptive management.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2019,6,Engineering and Related Technologies,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=201903&crn=13722,1314

AMST 747 Affect and Materiality,"Recent scholarship associated with the “affective turn” and “new materialisms” raises important questions about how we, as existents entangled in imperiled ecologies, know and collectively navigate our multispecies worlds. Refusing to accept classic oppositions between mind/body, self/other, and human/nonhuman, this work has inspired anthropologically inclined scholars to rethink the ways we analyze and write about the experiential regimes of settler colonialism, racialized capitalism, and heteronormativity. Rather than reifying divergent approaches to “affect” and “materiality” as discrete fields of knowledge, this course tracks these concepts across domains of inquiry in which they have long been urgently paramount: black, indigenous, and queer studies.

F&ES 714 Environmental Hydrology,"Groundwater quenches the thirst of more than one third of the planet’s population. It also supports 40 percent of the world’s irrigated agriculture, while enabling production of numerous commodities that make us comfortable and content. Groundwater is in high demand and, in some places, we’ve taken too much, causing streams to disappear, land to sink, and wells to run dry. Groundwater in other places has been ruined by pollutants that are dangerous side effects of mining, reckless agricultural practices, and unchecked industrial processes. Unless we begin to make better decisions, stresses on groundwater resources will worsen, ultimately to the detriment of human health, food security, and ecosystems. This course introduces principles of and approaches to hydrologic science requisite to informing the smart management of groundwater resources. It is designed for M.E.M., M.E.Sc., and Ph.D. students seeking to (i) learn about processes governing the circulation, availability, and quality of groundwater; (ii) apply hydrological models used by environmental professionals to evaluate groundwater resource issues; (iii) gain familiarity with methods used to interpret data encountered in groundwater-oriented problems; and (iv) sharpen analytical skills that have broad application to environmental science and management. Hydrology is a quantitative science, so students enrolled in F&ES 714 should be comfortable with arithmetic and algebra and should have completed at least one semester of college calculus. Students use hydrologic simulation models during this course and may, depending on the level of interest, learn to develop simple computer models themselves. But previous experience with hydrologic models or computer programming is not assumed or needed to succeed in the course. There is very little content overlap between F&ES 714 and other F&ES courses, including F&ES 724.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2020,6,Natural and Physical Sciences,Professional services,https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202001&crn=30020,1357
F&ES 975 Environmental Justice: Research & Practice at the Intersection of Civil Rights & the Environment,"Students in the spring 2020 Environmental Justice Capstone have the opportunity to apply theory, knowledge, and skills to real-world experience working on projects to address inequality and race discrimination in the distribution of health hazards as well as procedural inequities experienced by communities as they try to assert their own vision for the future of their neighborhoods, towns, and cities. Students have previously worked on projects that included: drafting federal legislation in consultation with community and advocacy groups across the country that would place a moratorium on concentrated animal-feeding operations and enact other measures to limit their impacts; research and drafting public comments to be filed on behalf of environmental justice organizations regarding recently proposed changes to NEPA; research and analysis of the impacts of a landfill in a historically black community in Alabama, analyzing landfill permit variances and assessing the relationship between race and landfill locations in Alabama. Projects in the spring may include an assessment of whether a state environmental department’s response to complaints about environmental hazards varies with race; investigation into the validity of “confidential business information” claims shielding information about toxic chemicals from the public; and/or comments on rule making at the federal level that may threaten the confidentiality of data on community members engaged in community-based participatory research. The term begins with a “bootcamp” intended to provide an orientation on key substantive information and the work of the capstone. Students then participate in a weekly seminar intended to explore issues raised by the application of knowledge, skills, and approaches to the environmental justice context, including both substantive issues of environmental and civil rights law and policy, as well as questions related to practice, including ethical and social dimensions of providing technical assistance in this context. In addition to class meetings and preparation, students must complete project work. They are  also expected to participate in team meetings. While there is no prerequisite for the capstone, participants should have a strong interest in working on behalf of environmentally overburdened communities—often communities of color and low-income communities. To apply, send a c.v. and short statement of interest (under a page please) to marianne.engelman-lado@yale.edu by December 1. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis.

F&ES 838 Environmental Product Life-Cycle Assessment,"Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is an analytical method that aims to quantify potential environmental impacts along the entire life cycle of a product, from extraction or harvest of natural, mineral, or fossil resources through production, distribution, and consumption, to final end-of-life disposal or reuse/recycling. LCA provides a quantitative evaluation of a wide range of environmental issues to avoid unintended consequences such as shifting the burden between different life stages or different environmental concerns. Its primary applications include decision support in the context of design-for-environment programs and policy making as well as providing a science-based basis for environmental claims used for marketing products in business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) settings. The course is split into a lecture and a software lab. The lecture conveys the general principles and relevant definitions of the LCA methodology as defined in the ISO 14040 series of standards and exemplifies them through reference to real-world examples covering different industry sectors and product categories. The overall goal of the lecture is to provide the knowledge necessary to scope, manage, and scrutinize LCA studies in the business, consulting, or government sectors. In addition to the lecture, students receive training on the professional-grade GaBi software for life-cycle assessment to provide them with the necessary practical skills and life-cycle inventory data to complete their class projects, which will be an LCA study of their own choosing. The goal of the software training is to provide the basic practical skills necessary to conduct life-cycle inventory modeling and to convey a deeper understanding of the complexities and challenges associated with LCA in practice.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2020,12,Environmental and Related Studies,Manufacturing,https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202001&crn=20598,1361

F&ES 820 Land Use Law and Environmental Planning,"This course explores the regulation by local governments of land uses in urban, rural, and suburban areas and the effect of development on the natural environment. The course helps students understand how the environment can be protected through effective regulation at the local level. It provides an introduction to federal, state, regional, and local laws and programs that promote watershed protection and to the laws that delegate to local governments primary responsibility for decision-making in the land use field. Theories of federalism, regionalism, states’ rights, and localism are studied, as are the cases that provide a foundation in regulatory takings and the legitimate scope of land use regulation. The history of the delegation of planning and land use authority to local governments is traced, leading to an examination of local land use practices that relate to human settlement patterns, water resources, low-impact development, watershed protection, alternatives to Euclidean zoning, brownfields redevelopment, and resiliency and adaptation in response to sea-level rise and climate change. Students engage in empirical research to identify, catalog, and evaluate innovative local laws that successfully protect environmental functions and natural resources, and the manner in which towns incorporate climate change into their planning and regulations. Nearby watersheds are used as a context for the students’ understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of local planning and regulation. Attention is paid, in detail, to how the development of the land adversely affects natural resources and how these impacts can be mitigated through local planning and subsequent adoption of environmental and other regulations designed to promote sustainable development in a climate-changing world.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2020,"6, 11, 13, 16",Environmental and Related Studies,Public administration and safety,https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202001&crn=30022,1382
"F&ES 964 Large-Scale Conservation: Integrating Science, Management, and Policy","Environmental sustainability and human dignity are important societal goals, but figuring out how to achieve them on large scales—geographic, temporal, and in terms of complexity—has proven to be extremely challenging. Abundant trend data show that many species, ecosystems, and other environmental and human systems are being overused, stressed, or degraded, thus undercutting the likelihood that we can reach sustainability and human rights for all. In addition, our institutions for science, management, and policy are not designed to address sustainability challenges on these scales. Over the past few decades numerous management and policy initiatives have been put forward to address large-scale resource use, including single and multiple use, parks and protected areas, ecosystem management, bioregional planning, integrated conservation and development, transboundary approaches, and adaptive governance. This course (a mixed seminar and practicum) explicitly uses an integrative (i.e., via interdisciplinary) framework to examine the conceptual and contextual basis for these efforts; compares and contrasts their scientific, management, and policy components; explores themes of leadership, problem solving, decision-making, governance, change, and learning; and surveys cases from three arenas (terrestrial, aquatic, and marine). The course takes a problem-oriented, contextual, and multi-method approach that offers students conceptual, practical, and professional benefits. It includes readings, lectures, discussions, workshops, exercises, oral presentations, guest speakers, individual and small-group assignments, and possibly a field trip and group project. In past years the course took a field trip to the Connecticut River system to evaluate region-wide conservation efforts, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and the Grand Canyon Ecosystem. It also organized an international workshop focused on the Yellowstone to Yukon initiative, and assisted a major U.S. NGO plan for transboundary projects along the U.S.-Canadian border.

F&ES 839 Social Science of Conservation and Development,"This course is designed to provide a fundamental understanding of the social aspects involved in implementing conservation and sustainable development projects. Social science makes two contributions to the practice of conservation and development. First, it provides ways of thinking about, researching, and working with social groupings—including rural households and communities, but also development and conservation institutions, states, and NGOs. This aspect includes relations between groups at all these levels, and especially the role of politics and power in these relations. Second, social science tackles the analysis of the knowledge systems that implicitly shape conservation and development policy and impinge on practice. The emphasis throughout is on how these things shape the practice of sustainable development and conservation. Case studies used in the course have been balanced as much as possible between Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, and Latin America; most are rural and Third World. The course includes readings from all noneconomic social sciences. The goal is to stimulate students to apply informed and critical thinking (which means not criticizing others, but questioning our own underlying assumptions) to whatever roles they may come to play in conservation and sustainable development, in order to move toward more environmentally and socially sustainable projects and policies. The course is also designed to help students shape future research by learning to ask questions that build on, but are unanswered by, the social science theory of conservation and development.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Yale University,2020,"10, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://courses.yale.edu/?details&srcdb=202001&crn=29965,1412

EVST 205 The Human Population Explosion,"The world adds a billion people every twelve years. The increasing human environmental footprint overwhelms efforts at conservation and remediation. Whether one is concerned about the environment or human poverty, health and well-being, the continuing population explosion looms as a dominant factor. The nexus of deep poverty and increasing population derails many efforts at human economic development. The introduction of family planning around the world and the fall in global fertility that it has allowed is one of the great revolutions in human history. This survey course introduces the biological, historical, economic, and cultural factors that determine human population growth. Starting with an evolutionary background, we trace the historical stages of population growth and how cultures have maintained reproduction at a sustainable rate and how the modern decline of mortality led to the population explosion. We probe the effects of large and high-consuming populations and efforts to re-stabilize population. Topics include the political, religious, and ethical issues surrounding fertility: infanticide, abortion, contraception, son preference, government coercion, migration, and the status of women. Many topics are highly controversial and students are encouraged to present a diverse set of views.

ARCH 3229 Urban History of Amazonia,"The urban frontier in Amazonia is among the fastest growing in the world: 80 percent of it is “informal.” Under export-oriented, neo-extractivist policies, this trend is unlikely to revert. Nevertheless, scarce research has focused on the urban phenomenon in Amazonia. How can burgeoning forest cities be retrofitted/designed? Could urbanization be allied with forest resurgence in the region? Can environmental history and archaeology influence the way in which we approach Amazonian settlements? What can we learn from local communities? Could their ancestral knowledge be adapted to current needs and illuminate design? In this seminar, we critically probe current approaches to sustainability, aware that “green solutions” being advanced by the global north often demand further extraction of natural resources in the global south. We analyze the complex intertwining between global capitalism and Amazonia, as well as the critical role both are called to play in lieu of climate change.

ETHICSOC 136R: Introduction to Global Justice,"Our world is divided into many different states, each of which has its own culture or set of cultures. Vast inequalities of wealth and power exist between citizens of the rich world and the global poor. International commerce, immigration, and climate change entwine our lives in ways that transcend borders. It is in this context that problems of global justice, which relate to the normative obligations that arise from our international order, emerge. What demands (if any) does justice impose on institutions and individuals acting in a global context? Is it morally permissible to prioritize the welfare of our compatriots over the welfare of foreigners? Do states have the right to control their borders? What are the responsibilities (if any) of wealthy states, consumers, and multinational corporations to the global poor? This course explores longstanding problems of global justice via a discussion of contemporary issues: global poverty, global public health, immigration, human rights and humanitarian intervention, self-determination, and climate change.n nThere are no easy answers to these questions, and the complexity of these issues requires an interdisciplinary approach. While there are several possible theoretical approaches to problems of global justice, the approach taken in this course will be rooted in political philosophy and political theory. We will combine readings from political philosophy and theory with empirical material from the social sciences, newspaper articles, and popular media. By the end of this course, students will be familiar with contemporary problems of global justice, be able to critically assess theoretical approaches to these problems, and be able to formulate and defend their own views on these complex issues.",　,　,Undergraudate course,United States,Stanford University,2021,"1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 16",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=ETHICSOC+136R&collapse=,1470

LAW 912A: International Human Rights and Conflict Resolution Clinic: Clinical Practice,"In the past half-century, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discourse and practice. This Clinic gives students the opportunity to work directly with the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as they navigate the vast challenges faced by human rights advocates and victims. In addition to operating within the human rights framework, students will also have occasion to study and contribute to efforts to resolve situations of tension and ongoing conflict using tools of transitional justice and conflict mitigation. The course aims to help students develop a broad range of multidisciplinary human rights advocacy skills--including factual documentation; litigation before national, regional, and international institutions; community empowerment strategies; and client enfranchisement and representation--through in-class sessions, role play exercises, and engagement in, and critical assessment of, clinical projects in human rights. This Clinic involves both a weekly seminar as well as work directly with clients and partner organizations (i.e. Clinic Projects). Together, these experiences give students the chance to reflect upon a number of foundational questions including: What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in rights promotion and defense? How is conflict resolution consistent with human rights advocacy? When and where are these approaches in tension? Students will also be confronted with the ethical and strategic issues that arise in the course of doing human rights work and balancing the often differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the (frequently non-western) developing world. In some sessions, part of the class will be devoted to presentations by students and clinical rounds in line with greater Mills Legal Clinic model. These presentations will consider one or more issues that arise in the course of students' own engagement in advocacy projects through the Clinic. During the course of the quarter, in addition to their work for their clients and partners, students will also be required to write several short, critical reflection papers or thought pieces (2-4 pages, double-spaced, or 500-1,000 words) on the readings, their Clinic Project(s), and/or human rights events on campus. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses. The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. As a general rule, students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work/projects (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond ""normal business hours."" Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical work product (i.e., the students' substantive contributions); clinical methods (which includes consideration of the students' lawyering skills, leadership, and professionalism); and clinical coursework (which focuses on the students' seminar participation, simulations, and reflection papers). Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Elements used in grading include: Attendance, class participation, written assignments, professionalism, ability to work with others successfully, creative thinking, peer review, and commitment to the clinical enterprise. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and the clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled. For information about advanced clinics, please see the course descriptions for those courses. For more information about clinic enrollment and operations, please see the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,"10, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=LAW+912A&collapse=,1561

POLECON 230: Strategy Beyond Markets,"Politicians, regulators, and voters place limits on - and present opportunities for - nearly every business. Firms like Uber, Airbnb, and Google do not only remain cognizant of existing laws, they also look for opportunities to change the law in ways that help their business. In this class, we will learn how businesses can influence political decision-making and develop frameworks for political strategy. We will examine firms' interactions with competitive firms, market incumbents, customers, and institutions, including interest groups, legislatures, regulatory agencies, courts, international organizations, and the public. Case studies include intellectual property, health care reform, carried interest in private equity, ride-sharing, and peer-to-peer lending. Students will complete the course with a better appreciation of how politics works, of the opportunities and perils associated with alternative political goals, and of tactics likely to achieve those goals.

"STS 200A: Food and Society: Politics, Culture and Technology","This course will examine how politics, culture, and technology intersect in our food practices. Through a survey of academic, journalistic, and artistic works on food and eating, the course will explore a set of key analytical frameworks and conceptual tools in STS, such as the politics of technology, classification and identity, and nature/culture boundaries. The topics covered include: the industrialization of agriculture; technology and the modes of eating (e.g., the rise of restaurants); food taboos; globalization and local foodways; food and environmentalism; and new technologies in production (e.g., genetically modified food). Through food as a window, the course intends to achieve two broad intellectual goals. First, students will explore various theoretical and methodological approaches in STS. In particular, they will pay particular attention to the ways in which politics, culture, and technology intersect in food practices. Second, student will develop a set of basic skills and tools for their own critical thinking and empirical research, and design and conduct independent research on a topic related to food.

SUST 240: Sustainability Leadership Practicum,"The Sustainability Leadership Practicum provides an opportunity for students in the SUST master's program to practice, integrate and internalize core lessons from the program curriculum. Students will independently complete a 120-hour Practicum project of their own design, collaborating on a complex sustainability challenge with an outside partner and working through the types of constraints often faced by decision makers and leaders. Through the Practicum experience, students reflect on and exercise the knowledge, mindsets and practical skills developed through their SUST coursework, including the foundational program concepts of complex social-environmental systems, change leadership, and systems innovation and transformation. Ultimately, the Practicum is designed to develop each student's identity and capacity as a transformative leader through practice. While the Practicum can be carried out and the units earned at any time during the master's program, students are encouraged to start the planning process early, allowing plenty of time to forge a relationship with a partner organization and develop a thoughtful and feasible proposal (to be approved by program leadership and the student's advisor) prior to carrying out their Practicum fieldwork. Deliverables include an analytical paper and a 15-minute final presentation. This course does not convene in a classroom setting.

THINK 40: Sustainability Challenges and Transitions,"What are the most critical sustainability challenges facing us in this century? How can natural and social sciences, humanities, and technology fields interact to contribute to their solution? How do we balance the needs and desires of current generations with the needs of future generations? The term sustainability seems to be everywhere. Businesses, cities, non-governmental organizations, individuals, and universities such as Stanford use the term to characterize decisions that make sense for the well-being of people as well as the environment. Beyond the popular use of the term is an emerging field of study that focuses on the goals of sustainable development - improving human well-being while preserving Earth's life support systems (air, water, climate, ecosystems) over the long run - and explores how science and technology can contribute to the solution of some of the most critical problems of the 21st Century. The goal of this course is to engage you in critical thinking and analysis about complex sustainability challenges and to encourage you to consider the need for integrative solutions that draw on different disciplines. We will examine some of the major problems of sustainable development (including issues related to food, water, and energy resources, climate change, and protection of ecosystem services), grapple with the complexities of problem solving in complex human-environment systems, and participate in the design of effective strategies and policies for meeting sustainability goals. You will learn to develop policy briefs addressing sustainability issues in the university, local communities, state and the nation as well as work on team projects with decision makers that address real-life challenges in your local area.",　,　,Undergraudate course,United States,Stanford University,2018,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17",Environmental and Related Studies,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=THINK+40&view=catalog&page=0&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&collapse=&academicYear=20182019,1577

How should resources, like human organs, be allocated?nWhat obligations does the U.S. have regarding health care in resource-poor environments, such as underdeveloped nations?nWe live in a world of constrained resources. Nowhere are these constraints more controversial and significant than in health care where lives literally hang in the balance of the decisions we make. This course will provide students with the tools to address these questions through the theoretical framework of justice and ethics. We will address the question of allocation at the level of health policy and health economics before applying the concepts to the institutional and bedside level. Using real world examples, you will be asked to actively engage in debating controversial topics such as organ transplants and how to assign scarce ICU beds. Using both empirical data and the framework of ethics, you will be asked to consider how a health care committee, or a hospital, or an individual doctor might make decisions.",　,　,Undergraudate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,"3, 10, 16",Health,Health care and social assistance,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=THINK+56&view=catalog&page=0&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&collapse=&academicYear=20212022,1578

Have we reached a point where we need to replace the idea of progress with that of sustainability? These are some of the questions this course will raise as it looks at how ideas of progress inform western thinking about science, history, evolution, and politics. It will engage with thinkers who argued in favor of the idea of progress as well as thinkers who attacked its presumptions. Reading and critically evaluating philosophical, scientific, and literary texts, we will investigate the different consequences of our residual belief in progress, as well as the consequences of our possible abandonment of that belief.",　,　,Undergraudate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,"11, 16",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=THINK+57&collapse=,1579
URBANST 110: Introduction to Urban Studies ,"Today, for the first time in history, a majority of people live in cities. By 2050, cities will hold two-thirds of the world¿s population. This transformation touches everyone, and raises critical questions. What draws people to live in cities? How will urban growth affect the world¿s environment? Why are cities so divided by race and by class, and what can be done about it? How do cities change who we are, and how can we change cities? In this class, you will learn to see cities in new ways, from the smallest everyday interactions on a city sidewalk to the largest patterns of global migration and trade. We will use specific examples from cities around the world to illustrate the concepts that we learn in class.

AA 108N: Surviving Space,"Space is dangerous. Anything we put into orbit has to survive the intense forces experienced during launch, extreme temperature changes, impacts by cosmic rays and energetic protons and electrons, as well as hits by human-made orbital debris and meteoroids. If we venture beyond Earth's sphere of influence, we must also then endure the extreme plasma environment without the protection of our magnetic field. With all of these potential hazards, it is remarkable that our space program has experienced so few catastrophic failures. In this seminar, students will learn how engineers design and test spacecraft to ensure survivability in this harsh space environment. We will explore three different space environment scenarios, including a small satellite that must survive in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), a large spacecraft headed to rendezvous with an asteroid, and a human spaceflight mission to Mars.",　,　,Undergraudate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,9,Engineering and Related Technologies,Manufacturing,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=AA+108N&collapse=,1582
AA 109Q: Aerodynamics of Race Cars,"Almost as soon as cars had been invented, races of various kinds were organized. In all its forms (open-wheel, touring car, sports car, production-car, one-make, stock car, etc.), car racing is today a very popular sport with a huge media coverage and significant commercial sponsorships. More importantly, it is a proving ground for new technologies and a battlefield for the giants of the automotive industry. While race car performance depends on elements such as engine power, chassis design, tire adhesion and of course, the driver, aerodynamics probably plays the most vital role in determining the performance and efficiency of a race car. Front and/or rear wings are visible on many of them. During this seminar, you will learn about many other critical components of a race car including diffusers and add-ons such as vortex generators and spoilers. You will also discover that due to the competitive nature of this sport and its associated short design cycles, engineering decisions about a race car must rely on combined information from track, wind tunnel, and numerical computations. It is clear that airplanes fly on wings. However, when you have completed this seminar, you will be able to understand that cars fly on their tires. You will also be able to appreciate that aerodynamics is important not only for drag reduction, but also for increasing cornering speeds and lateral stability. You will be able to correlate between a race car shape and the aerodynamics effects intended for influencing performance. And if you have been a fan of the Ferrari 458 Italia, you will be able to figure out what that black moustache in the front of the car was for.",　,　,Undergraudate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,9,Engineering and Related Technologies,Manufacturing,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=&q=AA+109Q&collapse=,1583

From the space race led by governments as an outgrowth of the Cold War to the new era of space commercialization led by private companies and startups, more than 50 years have passed, characterized by great leaps forward and discoveries. We will learn how space missions are designed, from concept to execution, based on the professional experience of the lecturer and numerous examples of spacecraft, including unique hardware demonstrations by startups of the Silicon Valley. We will study the essentials of systems engineering as applicable to a variety of mission types, for communication, navigation, science, commercial, and military applications. We will explore the various elements of a space mission, including the spacecraft, ground, and launch segments with their functionalities. Special emphasis will be given to the design cycle, to understand how spacecraft are born, from the stakeholders' needs, through analysis, synthesis, all the way to their integration and validation. We will compare the current designs with those employed in the early days of the space age, and show the importance of economics in the development of spacecraft.

AA 122N: Dawn of the Drones: How Will Unmanned Aerial Systems Change Our World?,"Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have exploded on the scene in recent years, igniting a national debate about how to use them, how to regulate them, and how to make them safe. This seminar will dive into the many engineering challenges behind the headlines: in the future, how will we engineer UASs ranging in size from simple RC toys to highly-sophisticated autonomous scientific and military data gathering systems? This seminar will examine the key elements required to conceive, implement, deploy, and operate state-of-the-art of drone systems: What variety of problems can they help us solve? How autonomous are they and how autonomous do they need to be? What are the key technical bottlenecks preventing widespread deployment? How are they different from commercial aircraft? What kinds of companies will serve the market for UAV-related products and services? What business models will be successful and why? We will emphasize aspects of design, autonomy, reliability, navigation, sensing, and perception, as well as coordination/collaboration through a series of case studies drawn from our recent experience. Examples include imaging efforts to map the changing coral reefs in the South Pacific, using and controlling swarms of unmanned systems to perform search and rescue missions over large areas, and package delivery systems over large metropolitan areas.

We will read texts that ethnographically explore the experiences of refugees, labor migrants, tourists and seafarers, among others. In particular, we will look at the intersection of physical mobility and social mobility, as people often move in order to improve their life, to increase safety or economic security, or to gain social capital. However, the mobility perspective has also been criticized for depoliticizing and celebrating movement without critical attention to its socio-political and economic context. While mobility as a term points to the ability to move, human migration is at least as often characterized by restrictions and obstacles to movement, such as borders. We will think critically about the deep inequalities that exist in terms of why and how people move, and who are able to mobilize resources to move.",　,　,Undergraudate course,United States,Stanford University,2017,"8, 10, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=ANTHRO+135C&collapse=,1598

ECON 11N: Understanding the Welfare System,"Welfare-reform legislation passed by the federal government in the mid-1990s heralded a dramatic step in the movement that has been termed the devolution revolution, which is again being discussed in the context of healthcare reform. The centerpiece of devolution is the transfer of more responsibilities for antipoverty programs to the states. We will explore the effects of these reforms and the role that devolution plays in the ongoing debates over the designs of programs that make up America's social safety net. In addition to discussing conventional welfare programs (e.g., Medicaid, food stamps, TANF, SSI) and other governmental policies assisting low-income families (EITC, minimum wages), we will examine the trends in governmental spending on anti-poverty programs and how our nation defines poverty and eligibility for income support.

Yet, both in the past and today, policy makers have often expressed concerns that immigrants fail to integrate into US society and lower wages for existing workers. There is an increasingly heated debate about how strict migration policy should be. This debate is rarely based on discussion of facts about immigrants assimilation. This class will review the literature on historical and contemporary migrant flows. We will tackle three major questions in the economics of immigration: whether immigrants were positively or negatively selected from their sending countries; how immigrants assimilated into the US economy and society; and what effects that immigration may have on the economy, including the effect of immigration on native employment and wages. In each case, we will present studies covering the two main eras of US immigration history, the Age of Mass Migration from Europe (1850-1920) and the recent period of renewed mass migration from Asia and Latin America.

Energy use is woven throughout the fabric of modern societies, and energy systems are also a primary way that humans interact with the global Earth systems like climate. We know enough about the potential impacts of climate change to see that we need to transform the world¿s energy systems to a much cleaner set of technologies with much lower greenhouse gas emissions. Economies that use energy in a clean, cost-effective way will be much more competitive in the future. The clean energy transition is now underway, with reductions in coal use and rapid growth in solar and wind deployment, but there is much more to do to limit the adverse impacts of climate change. This seminar explores technology options available to make the changes needed, in the developed and developing worlds. There is no shortage of energy available for our use. Instead, the challenge is to convert those energy resources into services like electricity and transportation, and that conversion requires technology, as well as policies and markets that enable innovation. The scale of the world¿s energy systems is dauntingly large, and we will need a well-diversified set of options to meet the challenge. Wind, solar, nuclear, carbon capture and storage for fossil fuel use, modified agriculture, electric (and automated) vehicles, advanced air conditioning, and many other technology options exist. We will consider these technologies and ask what barriers will have to be addressed if they are to be deployed at a scale large enough to reduce the impact climate change.

ESS 185: Adaptation,"Adaptation is the process by which organisms or societies become better suited to their environments. In this class, we will explore three distinct but related notions of adaptation. Biological adaptations arise through natural selection, while cultural adaptations arise from a variety of processes, some of which closely resemble natural selection. A newer notion of adaptation has emerged in the context of climate change where adaptation takes on a highly instrumental, and often planned, quality as a response to the negative impacts of environmental change. We will discuss each of these ideas, using their commonalities and subtle differences to develop a broader understanding of the dynamic interplay between people and their environments. Topics covered will include, among others: evolution, natural selection, levels of selection, formal models of cultural evolution, replicator dynamics, resilience, rationality and its limits, complexity, adaptive management.",　,　,Undergraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,"13, 14, 15",Natural and Physical Sciences,Professional services,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=ESS+185&collapse=,1777

GSBGEN 305: Impact: Investing for Good,"Investing for Good will introduce students to the entire spectrum of purposeful, values-driven, and impact investing. We examine the field from the perspective of an institutional investor (i.e. fund manager, investment advisor, endowment manager, head of a family office, etc). Our goal is to have students emerge with a practical and analytical framework for: 1. evaluating impact and mission-aligned investments across multiple asset classes and sectors; 2. constructing a portfolio using impact as a lens; 3. designing an impact investment company; and 4. understanding the many practical and theoretical challenges confronting this exciting emerging field.We start by exploring some fundamental questions: what is a purposeful or impact investment; can impact investments be defined along a spectrum between conventional investing and philanthropy; whose money is it; what are the constraints and opportunities; how do we (re)define return and/or performance. We briefly analyze impact investing in the context of modern portfolio theory. We then develop a framework for portfolio construction and evaluation across four criteria: risk, return, liquidity, and impact. Through a combination of class dialogues, role plays, and case discussions, we will explore a wide variety of asset classes, impact themes, and investment challenges. A series of team-based investment committee simulations will comprise a significant portion of the course and will provide a significant experiential learning experience.Previous experience in finance, investing, social enterprise, entrepreneurship, or philanthropy is not required, but both helpful and welcomed. While first year students are encouraged to enroll, students who have limited familiarity with the basics of investing and corporate finance are strongly encouraged to purchase David Swensen's ""Pioneering Portfolio Management"" and cover the recommended chapters in advance of the course. It's is also important to note that this class will require financial modeling and detailed investment analysis.Many of the issues we'll be tackling have no unambiguous answers.

GSBGEN 314: Creating and Scaling High Potential Ventures in Developing Economies (Cases and Team Project),"This course addresses the distinctive challenges and opportunities of launching high-potential new ventures in developing economies. Developing economies are attractive targets for entrepreneurs because many are just starting to move up the growth curve, and they offer low-cost operating environments that can be great development labs for potentially disruptive innovations. They increase in attractiveness when their political institutions stabilize and they become more market-friendly. At the same time, developing economies pose serious challenges. Pioneering entrepreneurs take on significant risks to gain early mover advantages. Specifically, entrepreneurs will not be able to count on the same kind of supportive operating environments that we take for granted in the developed world. They often face cumbersome permit and licensing processes, poorly developed financial and labor markets, problematic import and export procedures, unreliable local supply chains, weak infrastructure, corruption, currency risks, limited investment capital, lack of financial exits and more. This course is designed to help would-be entrepreneurs - both founders and members of entrepreneurial teams - better understand and prepare for these issues as they pursue the opportunities and address the challenges to start, grow, and harvest their ventures in these environments.GSB314 combines a seminar/discussion format (Tuesdays) with a team-based project (Thursdays). For the Tuesday sessions, students will read about and discuss the key challenges described above and potential solutions. Guests will describe their own startup and investing experiences in developing economies and answer questions. A framework based on the recently published World Economic Forum (WEF) report on ""Entrepreneurial Ecosystems Around the Globe and Company Growth Dynamics"" will be used to structure the course. Each student will prepare a short write-up as a final assignment, for this portion of the course, on a case chosen from a selection provided by the instructors.The Thursday sessions is a team-based exercise for students who either have a specific idea or want to join a team of classmates to pursue more deeply an understanding of the team's country of focus and an initial investigation of the idea's viability. Students must come in willing to be team players and do the work necessary to complete this exercise over the full quarter. Each team member's contributions will be assessed by fellow teammates. Teams of AT LEAST 3 STUDENTS EACH will be formed before the start of class or on the first day of class at the latest so students can decide if they want to enroll. The team will describe, in a final presentation, the challenges and opportunities in their country using the WEF framework. The final presentation will also include the team's thoughts on the viability of their proposed venture and how it capitalizes on their country's assets and addresses its challenges. A detailed business plan is not required; however, specific recommendations and plans for next steps that would be carried out during a 3 to 6 month field and market research study in the country will be part of the final presentation.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2018,"8, 17",Humanities and Law,Apply to all organizations,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=GSBGEN+314&view=catalog&page=0&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&collapse=&academicYear=20182019,1793

HUMRTS 101: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives on Human Rights Theory and Practice,"This course will introduce students to the philosophical and historical foundations for the modern concept of human rights, as well as the international and domestic legal frameworks currently in force to protect and promote these rights. Students will learn about the broad landscape of institutions responsible for defining and enforcing human rights from scholars who study the institutions, and practitioners who have worked inside them. Throughout the quarter we will read and discuss critical scholarship about the gap between the promises and aspirations of international human rights covenants, and the ongoing realities of widespread oppression, exploitation, and atrocity happening around the world. We will welcome practitioners as well as guest faculty from departments across the university whose teaching and research touches on aspects of human rights within their respective fields of expertise. Throughout the course, we will explore how distinct perspectives, assumptions, and vocabulary of particular disciplinary communities affect the way scholars and practitioners trained in these fields approach, understand, and employ human rights concepts. HUMRTS 101 fulfills the gateway course requirement for the Minor in Human Rights, and is offered once per year, winter quarter. No prior knowledge or formal human rights education is required of students enrolling in this introductory course. Students of all years and majors are welcome to join. Students should enroll in Section 01 of the course for in-person instruction Tu/Th 2:45-4:45pm. Enrollment in Section 02 is available only by special consent of the instructor, for students with special circumstances who need to complete HUMRTS 101 for the Minor, but cannot regularly attend the class in person as scheduled for Section 01. Students enrolled in Section 02 will complete identical curriculum, and will engage with classmates from Section 02 on a single Canvas site, but will have asynchronous and remote scheduling options for lectures. These same asynchronous and remote options can also be made available to Section 01 students (if/when needed, at discrete times throughout the quarter) in the event of COVID-related disruptions to class (e.g. instructor illness, student quarantine).",　,　,Undergraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2021,"10, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=HUMRTS+101&collapse=,1801

Historical maps are analyzed both as GIS data sources, and as interpretative lenses through which we can glimpse the way human settlements and activity reveal social, political and economic dynamics whose legacies are still present today.",　,　,Undergraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2017,"1, 8, 11, 16",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=LATINAM+177&view=catalog&page=0&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&collapse=&academicYear=20172018,1804
LATINAM 248: Racial and Gender Inequalities in Latin America,"This course explores the intersection between racial and gender inequalities in Latin America focusing on the historical pattern of racism, sexism and discrimination, and on the political and social changes that have enabled Afro-descendants and women to achieve social rights in some countries of the region such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay. The first part of this course introduces the struggle of political movements taking into consideration the historical process of race and gender discrimination. It will address not only the history of blacks¿ and women's movements in the 20th century, but also racism and sexism as cultural and institutional elements that configure inequality in those countries. Socio-economic indicators, race and gender-based violence, and political participation will be analyzed. The second part of this course examines the most recent discourses about women and afro-descendant rights, and their political framework. It evaluates how they have changed public opinion, laws and the social, institutional and political environment of Latin America. Finally, this course discusses the ability of Afro-descendants and women movements to navigate in the current political climate and advance their rights.nCourse will be taught in Portuguese.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2021,"5, 10, 11, 16",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?q=LATINAM+248&view=catalog&page=0&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&collapse=&academicYear=20212022,1805
LAW 2504: Environmental Law and Policy,"Environmental law is critically important and endlessly fascinating. In this course, we will look at the major statutes and policies used, at both the federal and state levels, to protect humans and the environment against exposure to harmful substances, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Superfund, and the Resource Conservation & Recovery Act. We also will discuss the National Environmental Policy Act, which covers and extends beyond pollution control, and several class units will discuss climate change. The class will look not only at the substance of these laws and policies, but also at enforcement challenges, alternative legal mechanisms for advancing environmental policies, the role of market mechanisms in addressing environmental problems, and constitutional restrictions on environmental regulation. As part of the class, students will engage in a series of situational case studies designed to provide a better sense of the real-world issues faced by environmental lawyers and to teach students the skills and tactics needed to solve those issues.

LAW 2506: Natural Resources Law and Policy,"Natural resource management presents extremely difficult and contentious issues of law and public policy. Major debates continue to rage over issues such as the Endangered Species Act, whether the United States should permit drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, how to ensure equitable allocation of key resources such as water and energy, and how to prevent the overfishing of the oceans. This course is a survey course and will look at the National Environmental Protection Act (and environmental impact statements), wildlife protection, marine and fisheries management, water, energy, and public lands. Class sessions will include critical examinations of current law and policy and in-depth discussions of situational case studies that force you to consider how you would resolve real-life issues. Students will be expected to participate actively in class discussions. (Because this is a survey class, students interested in an in-depth understanding of water or energy issues should consider classes offered at the Law School specific to those subjects.)

LAW 2508: The Business of Water,"The Business of Water (2508): One of the fastest growing global economic sectors is water, and private water companies are playing an increasingly important role around the world in water management. This growing private involvement has sometimes clashed with the inherently public nature of water and generated controversies. In many cases, private companies have made important contributions to meeting water needs (e.g., in the development of new technologies and expanding water supplies). In other cases, however, the involvement of private companies has proven contentious (e.g., when private companies have taken over public water supply systems in developing countries such as Bolivia). This course will look at established or emerging water businesses and the legal, economic, and social issues that they generate. These businesses include investor-owned water utilities, water technology companies (e.g., companies investing in new desalination or water recycling technologies), water-right funds (who directly buy and sell water rights), social impact funds, innovative agricultural operations, infrastructure companies, and financial investors. The class will begin with two introductory classes. After that, each week will focus on a different business or sector. Company executives will attend these class session and discuss their business with the class. In most classes, we will examine (1) the viability and efficacy of the company's business plan, (2) the legal and/or social issues arising from the business' work, and (3) how the business might contribute to improved water management and policy. Each student will be expected to write (1) two short reflection papers during the course of the quarter on businesses that present to the class, and (2) a 10- to15-page paper at the conclusion on the class on a water company of the student's choice (including a potential company that the student might propose creating), a water sector, or a policy initiative that can improve the role that business plays in improving water management (either in a particular sector or more generally).",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,"3, 6",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=LAW+2508&collapse=,1808
"LAW 2510: California Coast: Science, Policy and Law","This interdisciplinary course integrates the legal, scientific, and policy dimensions of how we characterize and manage resource use and allocation along the California coast. We will use this geographic setting as the vehicle for exploring more generally how agencies, legislatures, and courts resolve resource-use conflicts and the role that scientific information and uncertainty play in the process. Our focus will be on the land-sea interface as we explore contemporary coastal land-use and marine resource decision-making, including coastal pollution, public health, ecosystem management; public access; private development; local community and state infrastructure; natural systems and significant threats; resource extraction; and conservation, mitigation and restoration. Students will learn the fundamental physics, chemistry, and biology of the coastal zone, tools for exploring data collected in the coastal ocean, and the institutional framework that shapes public and private decisions affecting coastal resources. There will be 3 to 4 written assignments addressing policy and science issues during the quarter, as well as a take-home final assignment. Special Instructions: In-class work and discussion is often done in interdisciplinary teams of students from the School of Law, the School of Engineering, the School of Humanities and Sciences, and the School of Earth, Energy, and Environmental Sciences.

"LAW 2512: Cities and Sustainability: Current Issues, Policy, and Law","Cities are on the front lines of solving many of society's sustainability problems, from advancing green buildings and clean energy, to preparing for the effects of climate change. With a diminishing role of the federal government on environmental policy and regulation, it is up to sub-nationals like states and cities to lead innovation and deployment of clean energy, resilience strategies, water management, and more. This class will explore the evolving role of cities in advancing sustainability from the lens of law, policy, planning, and governance. Some of the topics we will discuss in-depth include climate mitigation, clean energy, green buildings, climate adaptation and resilience, water supply and reuse, land use and transportation, and more. Case studies will focus on U.S. cities with some emphasis on California. Overarching themes across all content areas include legal constraints of city authority, governance, socioeconomic tradeoffs, and the roles of various types of institutions in developing, advancing, and advocating for local policy change.

LAW 2515: Environmental Justice,"This course will introduce environmental justice as a social movement, including its central substantive concerns (the needs of humans in the built environment rather than the need to protect the environment from humans) and its methods (community-based political organizing rather than professionalized judicial or legislative action). The bulk of the course will then pursue a broader conception of environmental justice today by using social science research, theory, and case studies to investigate the civil rights and poverty aspects of environmental safety and natural resources. The course will include units on: (1) toxic exposure and public health disparities stemming from the disproportionate siting of locally-unwanted land uses in poor neighborhoods of color; (2) access to natural resources and basic public services, including clean water, wastewater disposal, and open space; (3) tools in environmental justice advocacy (including community-based lawyering, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, common law nuisance actions, and transactional lawyering); (4) environmental justice issues in Indian Country, and (5) environmental justice issues in climate change policy. Much of the course material, including student presentations, will be grounded in the experiences and advocacy histories of specific communities, both urban and rural, across the country. This class is limited to 25 students, with an effort made to have students from SLS (20 students will be selected by lottery) and 5 non-law students by consent of instructor. Special Instructions: Students on the waitlist for the course will be admitted if spots are available on the basis of priority and degree program. Course requirements will include class participation, in-class presentation, and either response papers (section 01) or a long research paper for R credit (section 02).

LAW 2517: Modern Crosscurrents in Energy and Environmental Law,"This course explores the close relationship between energy and environmental law. We will work through the major energy sectors and, for each, discuss key environmental law and policy issues that are influencing energy production and use. Our focus will be on current issues. We'll explore environmental issues that are traditionally associated with the energy sector, including air emissions, waste disposal and cleanup, and oil spills, while also covering new environmental issues emerging from the energy sector including climate change-related regulatory and business risk issues, energy infrastructure permitting issues, and environmental pressure points on the utility industry and on renewable energy and conventional energy projects, more generally.

LAW 2519: Water Law,"This course will study how society allocates and protects its most crucial natural resource -- water. The emphasis will be on current legal and policy debates, although we will also examine the history of water development and politics. The course will focus on United States law and policy, but insights from the course are applicable to water regimes throughout the world, and we will occasionally look at law and policy elsewhere in the world for comparison. Among the many issues that we will consider are: how to allocate water during periods of scarcity (particularly as climate change leads to more extremes); alternative means of responding to the world's growing demands for water (including active conservation); the appropriate role for the market and private companies in meeting society's water needs; protection of threatened groundwater resources; environmental limits on water development (including the U.S. Endangered Species Act and the ""public trust"" doctrine); constitutional issues in water governance; the human right to water; Native American water rights; protection of water quality; challenges to the substantive reform of existing water law; and interstate and international disputes over water.

LAW 3009: Health Law: Improving Public Health,"This course examines how the law can be used to improve the public's health. The broad questions explored are: what authority does the government have to regulate in the interest of public health? How are individual rights balanced against this authority? What are the benefits and pitfalls of using laws and litigation to achieve public health goals? The course investigates these questions as they operate in a range of specific contexts, including preventing and controlling infectious diseases; preventing obesity; reducing tobacco use; ensuring access to medical care; reducing firearm injuries; addressing the opioid epidemic; and responding to public health emergencies like COVID-19. In examining these contexts, we will ask and answer questions such as, what do the Constitution and key statutes permit? What makes a good public health law? Where do we see success stories--and failures--in public health law? What ethical and economic arguments justify government intervention to shape individuals' and companies' health-related behaviors? Instruction is through interactive lectures with a significant amount of class discussion and some group exercises. Class Participation, Written Assignments, Final Exam.

LAW 5009: International Conflict Resolution,"This seminar examines the challenges of managing and resolving intractable political and violent intergroup and international conflicts. Employing an interdisciplinary approach drawing on social psychology, political science, game theory, and international law, the course identifies various strategic, psychological, and structural barriers that can impede the achievement of efficient solutions to conflicts. We will explore a conceptual framework for conflict management and resolution that draws not only on theoretical insights, but also builds on historical examples and practical experience in the realm of conflict resolution. This approach examines the need for the parties to conflicts to address the following questions in order to have prospects of creating peaceful relationships: (1) how can the parties to conflict develop a vision of a mutually bearable shared future; (2) how can parties develop trust in the enemy; (3) how can each side be persuaded, as part of a negotiated settlement, to accept losses that it will find very painful; and (4) how do we overcome the perceptions of injustice that each side are likely to have towards any compromise solution? We will consider both particular conflicts, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the South African transition to majority rule, as well as cross-cutting issues, such as the role international legal rules play in facilitating or impeding conflict resolution, the ways intragroup dynamics affect intergroup conflict resolution efforts, and the role of transitional justice mechanisms to address atrocities following civil wars.

LAW 5025: Global Poverty and the Law,"With more than a billion people living on less than $2 a day, global poverty is one of the biggest challenges currently facing humanity. Even though those who suffer the most are located in the developing world, many of the policies, economic opportunities, and legal actions that offer the biggest potential for global poverty alleviation are made in the United States. This course will provide an introduction to the study of global poverty. What causes poverty? Why have some parts of the developing world done better at alleviating poverty than others? Can the world ever be free of poverty, as the World Bank's official motto suggests? How is the COVID pandemic affecting global poverty, and how should policymakers think about any potential tradeoffs? More generally, what can aspiring lawyers do to improve the condition of the world's impoverished? These are some of the questions this course is designed to address. This course is intended especially for future lawyers and policymakers who seek a deeper understanding of the developing world. After a brief overview that will familiarize students with the major concepts and empirical debates in poverty and development studies, we will examine a variety of 'causes' of poverty, from poor governance to lack of economic opportunity to the role of society. Since this course is just as much about what can be done, we shall also consider applied approaches to poverty alleviation. These types of interventions include political/legal reforms such as anti-corruption initiatives, 'rule of law' interventions, right to information programs, privatization, and community-driven development models; economic solutions such as cash transfers and microfinance; and technological approaches such as new methods for measuring policy impact and the application of new technologies for state identification and distribution programs. In addition to more typical scholarly readings, students will review poverty alleviation policy proposals and contracts made by various stakeholders (academics, NGOs, states, international bodies, etc.). Grading is based on participation, a presentation of research or a proposal, and, in consultation with the professor, a research paper. The research paper may be a group project (Section 01) graded MP/R/F or an individual in-depth research proposal either of which could be the basis for future field research (Section 02) graded H/P/R/F. Students approved for Section 01 or Section 02 may receive R credit. Automatic grading penalty waived for research paper.

LAW 682G: Discussion: After Nature: Ecological Thinking and the Future of Democracy,"Many believe we have entered the Anthropocene -- an epoch in which humans are a force, maybe the driving force, in the development of the planet. In this new epoch of humanity, there is no more nature that stands apart from human beings. There is no place or living thing that we haven't changed. Our mark is on the cycle of weather and seasons, the global map of bioregions, and the DNA that organizes matter into life. The question is no longer how to preserve a wild world from human intrusion; it is what shape we will give to a world we can't help changing. As much as a scientific concept, the Anthropocene is a political and ethical idea. Saying that we live in the Anthropocene is a way of saying that we cannot avoid responsibility for the world we are making. Today, we have collective responsibility for, and can exercise collective intentionality about, how we move forward. These issues are explored in Jedediah Purdy's book After Nature, which looks back at the intellectual history of environmental thinking and the American landscape and forward toward the future of nature. The dawning of the Anthropocene raises political and ethical questions about what life is worth, what people owe one another, and what in the world is awesome or beautiful enough to preserve or (re)create. How society answers these questions will either reproduce and amplify existing inequalities or set in motion a different logic of democratic governance driven by notions of equity, interdependent obligations, and global justice. Using After Nature as our jumping off point, we will explore these ideas with the book's author (and visiting law professor) in a series of four meetings over the course of the spring term.

"LAW 7020: Ethics On the Edge: Business, Non-Profit Organizations, Government, and Individuals","The objective of the course is to explore the increasing ethical challenges in a world in which technology, global risks, and societal developments are accelerating faster than our understanding and the law can keep pace. We will unravel the factors contributing to the seemingly pervasive failure of ethics today among organizations and leaders across all sectors: business, government, non-profit, and academia. A framework for ethical decision-making underpins the course. There is significant space for personal reflection and forming your own views on a wide range of issues. Prominent guest speakers will attend certain sessions interactively. The relationship between ethics and culture, leadership, law, and global risks (inequality, privacy, financial system meltdown, cyber-terrorism, climate change, etc.) will inform discussion. A broad range of international topics might include: designer genetics; civilian space travel (Elon Musk's Mars plans); social media (e.g. Facebook Cambridge Analytica, on-line sex trafficking, monopolies); new devises (e.g. Amazon Alexa in hotel rooms); free speech on University campuses; opioid addiction; AI (from racism to the work challenge and beyond); corporate and financial sector scandals (Epi pen pricing, Theranos, Wells Fargo fraudulent account creation, Volkswagen emissions testing manipulation); and non-profit sector ethics challenges (e.g. NGOs engagement with ISIS and sexual misconduct in humanitarian aid (Oxfam case)). Final project in lieu of exam on a topic of student's choice. Attendance required. Class participation important (with multiple opportunities to earn participation credit beyond speaking in class). Strong emphasis on rigorous analysis, critical thinking and testing ideas in real-world contexts. Elements used in grading: Class Participation, Attendance, Written Assignments, and Final Paper.

LAW 7026: Immigration Law,"This survey course provides a foundation in the constitutional principles governing the regulation and rights of noncitizens, the immigration statutes and regulations that govern the admission and removal of noncitizens, and citizenship acquisition. As relevant, the course will explore contemporary issues related to immigrants' rights and immigration reform, including the areas of border enforcement and asylum rights, immigration detention, the intersection of criminal and immigration law, state and local regulation of immigrants, and constitutional limits on 'alienage' discrimination. Guest speakers may be invited for some topics. No prior course or background in immigration law is expected.

LAW 7040: Social Justice Impact Litigation: Issues and Strategies,"(Formerly Law 572) This seminar explores strategic, legal, and ethical issues related to using law reform and social justice litigation to advance the constitutional and civil rights of vulnerable communities. The seminar is designed to allow students to understand and grapple with some of the doctrinal and strategic issues faced by social justice litigators. The course will be informed by the instructor's thirty years of litigating cases, including in the Supreme Court, to advance immigrants' rights as the founder and former national director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project. Among the topics that may be included are selecting and using test cases; identifying plaintiffs; coalition litigation; strategic pleading; class action problems; the role of amicus briefs; suits for damages versus injunctive relief; standing and mootness; ethical problems; settlement strategies; use of public advocacy and media; the effect of lawsuits on policymakers and public officials; the role of government and agency lawyers; and litigation to achieve legislative change. Guest speakers will be invited. Enrollment is limited and the seminar is not open to 1L students. Students are expected to submit a series of reflections (totaling 18 pages) in response to seminar issues and guest speakers. In unusual cases, a student may be approved for Research (R) credit to write a substantial research paper on an approved topic of current significance. R credit is available only with the instructor's prior consent early in the quarter. Students approved for R credit will transfer from section (01) into section (02) after the term begins.

LAW 7051: Local Government Law,"This course will examine the source, scope and limits of local government power. It will consider the relationship of local governments to state and federal government and of the relationship of local governments to the individuals and communities within and around them. Specific themes will include the potential of local governments to be responsive democratic communities, the potential of local governments to become isolated or exclusive enclaves, and the effect of local governments on the metropolitan political economy. The course will examine state and federal doctrine that affects local government, political/ social theory and urban planning/ development literature. Students may write papers in lieu of the final exam. Upon instructor consent, students interested in writing should enroll in Law 427-0-02.

LAW 7067: Law and Policy in the Post-Obama Era,"This course will consider a number of current issues of law and policy that achieved prominence during the Presidency of Barack Obama and remain unresolved. These issues include: 1) immigration law reform and DACA, 2) the role of the Department of Justice in reforming local and federal criminal law enforcement, 3) the role of government policy in regulating the economy and financial system, in facilitating heath insurance, and in remedying economic inequality, 4) the proper balance between national security and civil liberties/human rights, as exemplified by the debates over the status of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and drone warfare. In each of these areas, and others, debates about law and policy had reached a seeming, or potential, consensus in early 2009, but that consensus quickly fell apart. In each area, the gap between differing formulations of law and policy that had existed until recently has widened. Keeping in mind the time limitations of this course, we will briefly examine most of these of law and policy -- the governing legal doctrines and policies, their evolution since 2009, and their present and future prospects. The course will ask: What accounts for these differing visions of law and policy? What accounts for the inability of the political and legal system to resolve them? What are the possible ways forward? Class format will consist mainly of readings and class discussion, and students are encouraged to bring their own perspectives to bear on these difficult and timely issues. Class will meet Monday-Thursday, January 8-11, 7:15 PM to 9:15 PM and Tuesday of the following week, January 16, 6:20 PM to 7:20 PM.

LAW 7823: Advanced Negotiation: International,"This hands-on, advanced seminar is designed to teach students how to prepare for, participate in, and critically evaluate complex multiparty negotiations in the public international field. Through experience-based learning, simulations, guest speakers and case studies the course will expose students to various types of international conflict resolution processes, including natural resource management and extractive industries, human rights protection, ceasefire negotiations, and peace agreements. Students will strengthen their written and oral skills, counseling, factual and legal analysis. Special attention will be paid to the role of mediators and facilitators in such processes. Prerequisites: Negotiation Seminar, its academic equivalent, or experience in the field. Students who have not fulfilled these prerequisites may still be admitted to the class, but required to attend a bootcamp in basic negotiation theory and methods on Saturday, April 2nd. Please describe prior negotiations coursework and experience on your Consent Form. SPILS students are especially encouraged to enroll. This course is also open to cross-registration by graduate students in a variety of departments and programs including International Policy Studies.

LAW 7824: Advanced Negotiation: Environmental Policy,"Advanced negotiation courses are designed to take students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar, to examine many facets of negotiation complexity, both in terms of the participants and topics. This section of Advanced Negotiation will focus on two-party and multi-party environmental policy negotiations, working in teams, group decision-making, coalition management, and negotiating on behalf of organizations to solve complex problems in environmental policy. The goals of the class are twofold, for students (1) to acquire an added theoretical base beyond what was covered in the Negotiation Seminar through which to analyze (in terms of law and facts), prepare for, participate in and facilitate more complex, multiparty negotiations, and (2) to expand skills through deeper examination of various actual negotiation cases and complex simulations, including ethical responsibilities to the client and the public, opportunities for leadership, and collaboration. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in the simulations is required. Passing is dependent upon active preparation and participation, submission of four assigned short reflection papers, and completion of a student-selected case analysis (a completed or ongoing environmental policy dialogue). Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar ( Law 7821) or its substantial equivalent. Advanced degree students (and graduate students in other departments and programs) are encouraged to enroll. The course is designed for students who have already taken a basic negotiation seminar, but students who have not taken Negotiation may still be admitted if they attend an intensive bootcamp in basic negotiation theory and methods the first Saturday of winter quarter, January 8.

LAW 7825: Advanced Negotiation: Transactions,"Advanced Negotiation takes students beyond the two-party, lawyer-client negotiations that were the focus of the Negotiation Seminar. This course, Advanced Negotiation: Transactions, places the student in more difficult and more nuanced transactional simulations, working as individuals, lawyer-client pairs, and teams to negotiate on behalf of business entities, governments, unions and NGOs. Simulations may include critical-path supply agreements, vendor/collaborator contracts, cross-cultural joint ventures, airline reorganization, founder/VC deals, big pharma arbitration resolution and multi-party private sector/government negotiations. The goals of the class include developing a designer's mindset for strategic preparation and client counseling on both facts and law, and tactical adjustments to changing scenarios; ethical responsibilities; deeper analysis and work on the persuasive elements (oral and written) of negotiation; coalition formation and management; improved tactical skills, methods of questioning, response control and, ultimately, improved confidence and competence. Special Instructions: Attendance at and participation in all simulations and debriefing sessions is required. Passing is dependent upon this active participation, and a series of short papers and/or in-class presentations. Prerequisite: Negotiation Seminar or its substantial equivalent, as assessed by the instructor. This class is limited to 20 students, 16 from SLS selected by lottery, with an effort to have 4 non-law students by consent of instructor.

LAW 806F: Policy Practicum: Accountability for the Unintended Consequences of Impact Investing,"As the impact investing industry grows exponentially into trillions of dollars, investors, scholars, and industry leaders are increasingly focused on improving metrics and standards. They recognize the need to define impact, critically evaluate philanthropic trade-offs, and apply due diligence standards to evaluate social and environmental risk. Despite this trend, however, no accountability framework exists to manage the potential for harm to people and the environment from impact investing. To ensure that impact investing lives up to its name, a system is needed that holds investors accountable for harm to local communities and their environments. Other traditional development finance institutions -- such as OPIC or the World Bank's IFC -- have been routinely applying policy and accountability frameworks for decades to manage their social and environmental risks and to remedy harm. When these institutions invest in a project, they bring environmental and human rights standards and citizen-driven complaint systems that local communities can use to address a grievance. If an impact investor (e.g. a private foundation, individual investor, or private bank¿s impact fund) is funding that same project without traditional development institutions involved, chances are there is no way that communities can have their voices heard or receive remedy for harm. Yet the failure to take seriously the risks of social and environmental harm can lead to catastrophic financial, human, and environmental outcomes. In ""Accountability: The Golden Opportunity in Impact Investing"" https://ssir.org/articles/entry/accountability_the_golden_opportunity_in_impact_investing , Natalie Bridgeman Fields describes Accountability Counsel cases in Liberia and Mexico that demonstrate not only the importance of community-driven accountability but also concrete examples of an accountability framework. This project develops a system that enables impact project asset owners access to information about their asset's compliance, evaluation tools, and grievance systems. The practicum team will work closely with Accountability Counsel staff to develop an accountability and learning system for impact investment that guarantees that assets: (1) comply with policies to protect people and the environment, (2) have evaluation tools that assess their impact, and (3) offer grievance methods to address social or environmental harms associated when they do occur. The potential positive impact for impact investing grounded in an accountability framework is staggering. According to a recent report from Morgan Stanley, ¿sustainable investment¿ has grown more than 33 percent over the last two years to $9 trillion, and will only continue to grow as impact investing becomes more accessible. If impact investing scales further without governance and accountability structures in place to prevent abuse and address harm, the consequences to local communities are dire. They will be certain to include the land grabs, contamination of water, labor rights abuses, and displacement of indigenous people that are typical of investments where there is weak rule of law and use of land and labor. Benefits of creating a robust accountability framework, if achieved, could spread beyond impact investing and could extend across global finance, including development finance, where existing frameworks could be improved based on leadership from the impact investing community. The practicum seeks interdisciplinary graduate students from law, international development, economics, project finance, impact investing, international human rights law, policy advocacy, business, and/or philanthropy. The research team will collaboratively produce a report for a sustained advocacy campaign with lessons and practices for accountability within impact investing. Elements used in grading: Attendance, Class Participation, Final Paper. NOTES: Students may not count more than a combined total of eight units of directed research projects and policy lab practica toward graduation unless the additional counted units are approved in advance by the Petitions Committee. Such approval will be granted only for good cause shown. Even in the case of a successful petition for additional units, a student cannot receive a letter grade for more than eight units of independent research (Policy Lab practicum, Directed Research, Directed Writing, Senior Thesis, and/or Research Track).

LAW 908A: Environmental Law Clinic: Clinical Practice,"Students enrolled in the Clinic provide legal assistance to national, regional and grassroots non-profit organizations on a variety of environmental issues, with a focus on complex natural resource conservation and biodiversity matters at the interface of law, science and policy. Working under the direct supervision of practicing environmental attorneys, Clinic students help screen new matters and potential clients; formulate strategies; research and develop factual and legal issues; and prosecute administrative and litigation proceedings. During the term, students may meet with clients, opposing counsel or agency decision-makers; review and prepare administrative records; develop expert testimony; draft comment letters, petitions, pleading or briefs; and/or attend and present arguments in administrative and court hearings. In regular one-on-one meetings with supervising faculty, there is a heavy emphasis on learning how to write persuasively and present oral arguments. Indeed, in any given quarter, our students typically prepare a mix of state and federal, and trial and appellate, court pleadings, and because all of our hearings during the academic year are conducted by students, many students also have the opportunity to present oral argument in front of one or more judges. In addition, students participate in a regular seminar where we examine strategic, ethical and substantive issues arising out of the Clinic's work. The Clinic is a particularly good place to learn how to conduct effective legal research, marshal facts in support of legal arguments, and, above all, write well. We practice at all levels of state and federal court and before many local, state and federal administrative agencies. Our work involves extensive motions practice and brief writing, and often involves administrative petitions and policy papers. Our work is inherently cross-disciplinary. No prior environmental experience or background is necessary, but an interest in learning about environmental and natural resources law is important. Special Instructions: General Structure of Clinical Courses - - The Law School's clinical courses are offered on a full-time basis for 12 units. This allows students to immerse themselves in the professional experience without the need to balance clinical projects with other classes, exams and papers. Students enrolled in a clinic are not permitted to enroll in any other classes, seminars, directed research or other credit-yielding activities within the Law School or University during the quarter in which they are enrolled in a clinic. Nor are they allowed to serve as teaching assistants who are expected to attend a class on a regular basis. There is a limited exception for joint degree students who are required to take specific courses each quarter and who would be foreclosed from ever taking a clinic unless allowed to co-register. These exceptions are approved on a case-by-case basis. Clinic students are expected to work in their clinical office during most business hours Monday through Friday. Students are also expected to be available by e-mail or cell phone when elsewhere during those hours. Because students have no other courses (and hence no exams or papers), the clinical quarter begins the first day of classes and runs through the final day of the examination period. Students should not plan personal travel during the Monday to Friday work week without prior authorization from the clinical supervisor. The work during a typical week in a clinic is divided into three components. First, as they are for practicing attorneys, most of the hours of any week are taken up by work on client matters or case work (this time includes meetings with instructors to discuss the work). Again, as is the case for practicing lawyers, in some weeks these responsibilities demand time above and beyond ""normal business hours."" Second, students will spend approximately five-to-seven hours per week preparing for and participating in weekly discussions or other group work in their individual clinic (scheduling varies by clinic). Third, over the course of the quarter each clinic student (with the exception of those enrolled in the Criminal Prosecution Clinic) is required to prepare for and attend a few inter-clinic group sessions. Students will be awarded three separate grades for their clinical quarter, each reflecting four units. The three grades are broken into the following categories: clinical practice; clinical methods; and clinical coursework. Grading is pursuant to the H/P system. Enrollment in a clinic is binding; once selected into a clinic to which he or she has applied, a student may not later drop the course except in limited and exceptional cases. Requests for withdrawal are processed through the formal petition and clinical faculty review process described in the clinic policy document posted on the SLS website. Students may not enroll in any clinic (full-time or advanced) which would result in them earning more than 27 clinical units during their law school career. The rules described here do not apply to advanced clinics for students who are continuing with a clinic in which they were previously enrolled.

LAWGEN 115N: Human Rights Advocacy,"What are the origins of the human rights movement and where is it headed? What does it mean to be a human rights activist? What are the main challenges and dilemmas facing those engaged in human rights advocacy? In the space of seven decades, human rights advocates have transformed a marginal utopian ideal into a central element of global discussion, if not practice. In this seminar we will examine the actors and organizations behind this remarkable development as well as the vast challenges faced by advocates in the recent past and today. Together, we will learn to be critical of, as well as to think, and act, like human rights advocates. This seminar will introduce you to some the main debates and dilemmas within the human rights movement. We will consider and understand the differing agendas of western international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) and their counterparts in the frequently non-western) developing world, as well as tensions between and among rights advocates along other important dimensions (civil and political vs. economic, social and cultural rights; rights promotion through engagement of powerful actors vs. challenging structures of power, etc.). The seminar seeks to develop your ability: 1) to understand human rights and social justice issues as contested political, legal and cultural phenomena; 2) to review advocacy texts, videos and other interventions critically; 3) to appreciate the political dimensions of efforts to promote human rights; 4) to understand how recent history constrains and structures options and possibilities for social intervention to promote rights and justice. During the course of the quarter you will be required to submit several short reflection papers and develop a human rights advocacy campaign.",　,　,Undergraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2018,"8, 10, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=LAWGEN+115N&collapse=,1836

MATSCI 301: Engineering Energy Policy Change,"Public policy and economic decisions profoundly affect all aspects of the energy ecosystem, including its supply, distribution, storage and utilization. These decisions can also influence the pace and focus of innovation of new technologies, including through government-funded research and development programs or regulatory efforts. This course will equip graduate students, who have strong science and engineering backgrounds, with a basic ability to understand and shape the ideation and implementation of sound energy and, related economic, policy. Building on case studies of both aspirational and reactive U.S. energy policy-making, students will design their own policy proposals for new, ambitious and achievable moonshot goals that advance a sustainable and prosperous future. In particular, students will choose a moonshot goal designed to reduce U.S. (and/or global) transportation-related emissions. These proposals may focus on specific mobility technologies (e.g., new zero-GHG liquid fuels), lead to transformation of mobility systems (e.g., integration of wide-scale automation into the transportation sector), or reduce emissions in another way altogether (e.g., moving manufacturing closer to consumption through 3-d printing).

"PHIL 363A: Seminar in History and Philosophy of Science: Democratic Science¿of the Climate, Races, H2O","Is the Earth's climate real? Does it exist beyond experimental data, computer simulation, and scientists' writings? This seminar considers philosophical, historical, and anthropological perspectives on the reality of scientific entities. It asks how these metaphysical questions are connected to our democratic societies and our position as scholars. We will ask whether Homo sapiens is sub-divided into races and ethnicities in the manner of a census form. And how genetics should interact with our social understanding of human diversity. Further, can the answers to these questions stand alone as isolated academic questions, or must they be tied together with our political philosophy and social norms? If democratic pluralism leads to metaphysical pluralism, what becomes of long-discarded scientific entities, such as phlogiston? Some argue that pluralism upsets our most basic scientific facts, like: water is H2O. nnThis graduate seminar examines these scientific entities - the climate, races, phlogiston - from perspectives in Philosophy, Anthropology, and History of Science. The course topics illustrate recent trends toward metaphysics in the humanistic study of science. Students will develop their ability to compare positions and arguments between disciplines. Class time will emphasize inter-disciplinary discussion. The major writing assignment is an essay with multiple drafts. This is designed to prepare students for writing and revising dissertation chapters and peer-reviewed articles. Activities may include a film screening and visit to a scientific laboratory.

"STRAMGT 306: Food, Health & Nutrition Entrepreneurship","Americans spend nearly 7% of their income on food items and another 5% on food services annually (US Census). Food spend is at the intersection of two of the most important industries in the US: health care and agriculture. Food production today supports the food consumption causing our extraordinary burden of disease; 75 cents of every dollar of the $4.8 billion spent annually on health care is for diet-related disease. The health care system accounts for over 17% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). Agriculture and agriculture-related industries contributed 4.8% to the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012. This course focuses on the shifting landscapes across these industries and subsequent market opportunities in food, health, and nutrition. The course is designed for students with a broad interest in the food or health systems and/or who are interested in careers in related fields. We will examine the food system from three points of view: the consumer, nutritional science, and policy. The class will focus on solving for consumer needs from the perspective of a health-promoting entrepreneur. The class will involve lecture, discussion, and prominent guest speakers who are entrepreneurs themselves or industry leaders.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2018,"2, 3",Business and Management,Manufacturing,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=STRAMGT+306&collapse=,1949
STRAMGT 545: Taking Social Innovation to Scale,"How do you get the best new social innovations to reach the hundreds of millions of people who need it the most? And how do ensure that they are developed, deployed and scaled in a way that is relevant, appropriate and sustainable? Innovators tackling the world's most difficult problems often ignore, misunderstand, and under-invest in the critical business challenges involved in crossing ""the middle of the value chain."" This is innovation's valley of death: product and system adaption and evaluation; evidence generation and design validation; business and partnership planning; formal or informal regulatory approval and registration. How do you design, introduce, and optimize the intervention's uptake before it can be taken to scale by markets, governments or other systems? The class is taught be Steve Davis, President & CEO of PATH ( www.path.org), a leader in global health innovation, and former global Director of Social Innovation at McKinsey & Company. We take an inter-disciplinary approach to look at the factors that pull innovation forward, push it from behind, and (often to the world's detriment) block its successful implementation and scaling. First grounding the discussion in research on innovation and social change, we then apply business principles, real world experiences and several important case studies in global health to examine the way good ideas get stuck, and how good ideas can turn into innovation that matters. We focus on root causes for failure, success factors, and business practices and tools to enable millions of lives to be impacted by social innovation. The seminar combines lectures, case studies, visiting practitioners and team projects focused on the business case for scaling specific social innovations. The goal is to help the next generation of social innovation leaders think more about some of the mistakes of the past, lessons for the future, and new ways of approaching old problems, all from a practitioner's point of view.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2019,8,Business and Management,Apply to all organizations,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=STRAMGT+545&collapse=,1950

STRAMGT 583: The Challenges in/with China,"The general objective of the course is to develop a better understanding of the changing socio-economic and political situation in China (with its challenges both for China and for the rest of the world) in order to make less difficult to define and implement sustainable strategies for managing effectively in China and for handling the complex and sensitive interdependence between China and the US, between China and the rest of the world. From assessing, critically, the performance of China today, its achievements and challenges, students will get an insight in the current complex dynamics of China renaissance/transformation and we will discuss alternative scenarios, with their business and socio-political consequences on the medium term. From this analysis and with a prospective perspective in mind, we will discuss responsible management practices required to build, overtime, a mutually rewarding, growing interdependence.nMore specifically, the course will initially identify the multi-causality behind China's achievements and discuss some of the dysfunctions associated, today, with such performance. The conditions of management effectiveness required to enter and succeed overtime in the Chinese market will be identified while the challenges faced by competition ¿ particularly in terms of management of innovation - and by the global expansion of Chinese firms overseas will be illustrated. The course will rely upon different pedagogical methods; it will create conditions to share and leverage participants' experience and it will make use of cases and research results.

STRAMGT 584: Impact: Assessing High Impact Business Models in Emerging Markets,"In recent years, we've seen an explosion of innovative business models blazing new trails in emerging markets. Many of these models are achieving commercial success while transforming the lives of low-income populations. Using nine cases of both early-stage, entrepreneur-led ventures and later-stage, public or large-cap firms, this course will examine best practices for scaling new enterprises in emerging markets. It will do so primarily through the lens of a potential investor. It will also explore what is required to spark, nurture and scale entire sectors that serve rapidly growing, often low-income markets. What does it mean to work in markets with limited infrastructure? What common mistakes are made - whether in business model design, in supply chains, or in dealing with government - and how can we avoid them? Which are the best business models to serve markets that corporations have traditionally ignored, and in which government has failed to deliver? Who might be threatened by the success of these new businesses? The seminar is a good match for Stanford students interested in working or investing in emerging markets. It will be taught by Matt Bannick, who led Omidyar Network (a $1 billion impact investing fund) and is the former President of eBay International and of PayPal.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Stanford University,2022,8,Business and Management,Wholesale and retail trade,https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&academicYear=20212022&q=STRAMGT+584&collapse=,1953
"STS 181: Techno-metabolism: Technology, Society, and the Anthropocene","In the Anthropocene epoch, humanity has become a geological force.

ANTHW2026 On Precarity,"The topic of precarity is a growing field in the social sciences. The main purpose of this course is to explore the wide semantics and potentials of the term in relation to domains such as labour, law, ethics, technology, health, relationships, moods, shifts in opinion, in fashions or the durability of goods. Our interest in precarity is grounded in two interrelated key motives: the first addresses it as an object of study in its own right. Judging from recent unemployment rates of the industrialized west, the mass scale displacement of populations or the corrosion of security, there is enough reason to put precarity into context. Yet, we might also proceed by inquiring about its potentials as a methodology, one might even call it “a style of reasoning”.  Given how much history relies on causation, sequence and linearity how to relate to precarity as a temporal structure in light of the complexities of the present? How does such multilateral present redefines the very conception of that present, of the historical and the now?
We will be relating to precarity not just as a condition of existence but also as an infrastructure with which to think societies across space and time. The course will focus on narratives, practices and structures that problematize and displace prima facie logics of the either/or. Instead, we want to highlight conjoined operations of the both/and which are changing the very nature of how we think norms, time and episteme. Taking a clue from the proliferation of forms of precarity, the course will be organized around specific themes. Within each two-week section, the first sessions will be a lecture and the remaining will combine lecture and discussion of the assigned items. As a whole, the course aims to sensitize students to the complexities and conditioning possibilities involved in the process of knowledge-making and to provide students with tools to better structure and critically access the information they receive and generate.",　,　,Undergraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2021,"3, 8, 9, 11",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/content/un2026-precarity-m-de-abreu,1972

Sound, noise, voice, reverberation, and silence, from the technological resonances produced by Edison, Bell, and others, to the theoretical reflections of John Cage and beyond: the course turns away from the screen and dominant epistemologies of the visual, for an extended moment, in active pursuit of sonorous objects and cultural sonorities.

Also, it is maintained that the environments that we build determine the ways we live and die. The dread infectious and acute diseases in the nineteenth century, the chronic, degenerative conditions of the twentieth and the new, vaguely understood conditions rooted in a changing chemical and human-made environment are emblematic of the societies we created. Among the questions that will be addressed are: How does the health status of Americans reflect and shape our history? How do ideas about health reflect broader attitudes and values in American history and culture? How does the American experience with pain, disability, and disease affect our actions and lives?

HRTS W3950 Human Rights and Human Wrongs,"This course will examine the tension between two contradictory trends in world politics. On the one hand, we have emerged from a century that has seen some of the most brutal practices ever perpetrated by states against their populations in the form of genocide, systematic torture, mass murder and ethnic cleansing. Many of these abuses occurred after the Holocaust, even though the mantra ""never again"" was viewed by many as a pledge never to allow a repeat of these practices. Events in the new century suggest that these trends will not end anytime soon. At the same time, since the middle of the twentieth century, for the first time in human history there has been a growing global consensus that all individuals are entitled to at least some level of protection from abuse by their governments. This concept of human rights has been institutionalized through international law, diplomacy, international discourse, transnational activism, and the foreign policies of many states. Over the past two decades, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and international tribunals have gone further than any institutions in human history to try to stem state abuses.

The course will be tailored to students’ interests, disciplinary backgrounds and research areas. The specific topics students will research and the methods they will employ will determine the substantive focus of readings.
During the course we will ask the following questions: ‘what is human rights research?,' 'how do you carry out research in an interdisciplinary field?', 'what distinguishes academic research from applied research and advocacy'? While answering these questions, you will become familiar with the literature on human rights methodologies, and you will engage in analysis and critical assessment of important human rights research literature.
In addition, the course gives a practical approach to research methodology. You will learn about a diverse set of methodologies, such as interviewing and focus groups, archival research, ethnographic and participant observation, interviewing focus groups, conducting online research; interpretive and non-empirical methods and basic quantitative methodologies to be employed in the study of human rights. As you learn about different methodological approaches, you will develop your own research project.

SDEV W2320 Economic and Financial Methods for Sustainable Development,"Prerequisites: Principles of Economics and one semester of calculus. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the skills and methods necessary to understand and evaluate the economic and financial aspects of sustainable development. Throughout the course, students will compare competing objectives and policies through the prism of economic & financial reasoning. Environmental economics and finance are broad areas covering all the multi-faceted and complex interactions between the economic system and the natural environment. Financial markets are the primary source of signals used to direct economic activity in a capitalist global economy. Economic activity is the primary determinant of the quality and sustainability of the natural environment. Students interested in sustainable development who are unfamiliar with economics and who do not develop a facility with economic and financial concepts are severely handicapped in their efforts to increase the level of environmental responsibility embedded in economic activity. This course is intended to provide students with a flying introduction to key analytical concepts required to understand topics in environmental economics and finance and to introduce them to selected topics within the field. The first part of the course (the Analytical Toolbox) is designed to provide a set of portable skills for two sets of students: a) those who will work in fields specifically devoted to sustainable development who, as part of their work, will need to engage with sources of economic & financial information and with discourses where sustainable development is not a focus; and b) students who may end up following careers in organizations where sustainability is not the primary objective. The topics and readings in the second part of the course were chosen to facilitate a critical engagement with the broad intellectual framework underlying sustainable development from the perspective of economics and finance. The topics are intended to create a community of intellectual discourse on sustainable development that will spill over beyond the classroom to the conversations of students and alumni that will far outlive graduation.

SDEV W3280 Workshop in Sustainable Development,"The upper level undergraduate Sustainable Development Workshop will be modeled on client based graduate-level workshops, but with more time devoted to methods of applied policy analysis and issues in Sustainable Development. The heart of the course is the group project on an issue of sustainable development with a faculty advisor providing guidance and ultimately grading student performance. Students would receive instruction on methodology, group work, communication and the context of policy analysis. Much of the reading in the course would be project-specific and identified by the student research teams. Offered in Fall and Spring.

SDEV W3310  Ethics of Sustainable Development,"Aiming to improve human conditions within many diverse environments, sustainable development seeks to create, increase and perpetuate benefit and to cease, rectify and reverse harm. Sustainable development is consequently inextricable from the fabric of ethics, woven with determinations of benefit and harm to the existence and well-being of both humans and nonhumans. Underlying such determinations are those of self- and other-regarding motivation and behavior; and underlying these are still others, of sensitivity and rationality in decision-making, whether individual, social or public. Sustainable development is interlaced with and contingent upon all these determinations, at once prescriptive and judgmental, which can be called the ethics of sustainable development. This course is divided into four main sections, of which two are intended to show the ethical fallacies of unsustainable development, and two, the ethical pathways of sustainable development. The first section focuses upon ethically problematic basic assumptions, including human (species) hegemony, happy (hedonic) materialism, and selective (data) denial. The second focuses upon ethically problematic ensuing rationalizations, including those pertaining to damages, victims, consequences and situations of climatic, chemical, biological and ecological harm. The third section responds to these rationalizations with ethically vital considerations of earth justice, environmental justice, culturally-based ethics, and sector-based ethics (water, food, place and climate ethics). Finally, the fourth section responds to the initial, longstanding problematic assumptions with a newly emergent ethical paradigm, comprising biotic wholeness, environmental integrity and the deliberative zero-goal. Tying all sections together is the central theme: to be sustainable, development must be ethical. Reflecting the collaborative quality of the field of sustainable development, the course extends to readings whose authors have all pursued their work at intersections of science and ethics, environment and ethics, policy and ethics, business and ethics, and sustainable development and ethics.",　,　,Undergraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,16, 17",Environmental and Related Studies,Apply to all organizations,https://www.coursicle.com/columbia/courses/SDEV/W3310/,2072
SDEV UN3330 Ecology and Social Systems for Sustainable Development,"The course provides an overview of the complex relationships between ecological and social systems. The course focuses on basic principles in understanding these relationships. After the students are introduced to these basic concepts, the course will focus on three current topics central to Sustainable Development for in-depth study. The emphasis is on the multiple perspectives – environmental, social and economic – required to understand and develop solutions to problems in sustainable development. The three topics are: conservation of biodiversity, payments for ecosystem services, and the ecology of food production. We expect these topics to vary from year to year to keep pace with current topics. The following areas will be covered:

What is an ecosystem?
How are social and ecological systems linked through the flow of energy and materials?
What are the characteristics of coupled human-natural systems? How do these systems function?
What are the current topics in sustainable development that require understanding of social and ecological systems?
For each topic (protection of biodiversity, ecosystem services, ecology of food production), what are the environmental, economic, and social perspectives important for sustainable solutions?
How can critical thinking be applied to balance these perspectives to derive sustainable solution?
Data analysis and approaches to analyze ecosystems and options for sustainable development.

SDEV W3355 Climate Change and Law,"The purpose of this course is to provide students with a broad introduction to the field of climate law in the United States and at the international level. The course begins with an overview of the causes and effects of global climate change and the methods available to control and adapt to it. We then examine the negotiation, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Copenhagen Accord. The focus then turns to the past and proposed actions of the U.S. Congress, the executive branch and the courts, as well as regional, state and municipal efforts. The Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act will receive special attention. We evaluate the various legal tools that are available to address climate change, including cap-and-trade schemes; carbon taxation; command-and-control regulation; litigation; securities disclosures; and voluntary action. The roles of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, carbon capture and sequestration, and forestry and agriculture each receive close attention.

SDEV 3360 Disasters and Development,"EESC 2330; SDEV W2300. Human welfare status is very unevenly distributed throughout the globe - some of us live very comfortable lives, others remain in desperate poverty showing little progress away from their condition. Between are countries that are rapidly developing and converging toward the welfare of the richest. At all levels of economic development human activities place significant pressure on the environment and threatens all of Earth’s vital functions and support systems for human life. This challenge requires timely responses based on solid understanding of the human/environment interface, technological and economic approaches to mitigate adverse effects on the environment, and routes to understanding the complex dynamics of the coupled human/natural systems that can chart a pathway to improvement in the lives of the poorest and continued well-being for those who have achieved prosperity without forcing natural systems into decline or massive fluctuation. This course offers undergraduate students, for the first time, a comprehensive course on the link between natural disaster events and human development at all levels of welfare. It explores the role that natural disasters might have and have had in modulating development prospects. Any student seriously interested in sustainable development, especially in light of climate change, must study the nature of extreme events - their causes, global distribution and likelihood of future change. This course will cover not only the nature of extreme events, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and droughts but also their transformation into disaster through social processes. It will ultimately help students to understand the link between such extreme events, the economic/social shock they represent and development outcomes. The course will combine careful analysis of the natural and social systems dynamics that give rise to disasters and examine through group learning case studies from the many disasters that have occurred in the first decade of the 21st century.

SDEV GU4050 US Water and Energy Policy,"Course Summary: Water, one of humankind’s first power sources, remains critically important to the task of maintaining a sustainable energy supply, in the United States and elsewhere. Conversely, the need to provide safe drinking water and keep America’s rivers clean cannot be met without access to reliable energy supplies. As the impact of climate disruption and other resource constraints begins to mount, the water/energy nexus is growing increasingly complex and conflict-prone. Essential Connections begins by examining the development of America’s water and energy policies over the past century and how such policies helped to shape present-day environmental law and regulation. Our focus then turns to the current state of US water and energy resources and policy, covering issues such as oil and gas exploration, nuclear energy, hydroelectric power and renewables. We also examine questions of inclusion and equity in connection with the ways in which communities allocate their water and energy resources and burdens along racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. The third and final section of the course addresses the prospects for establishing water and energy policies that can withstand climate disruption, scarcity and, perhaps most importantly, America’s seemingly endless appetite for political dysfunction. By semester’s end, students will better understand the state of America’s energy and water supply systems and current efforts to cope with depletion, climate change and related threats affecting these critical, highly-interdependent systems. As a final project, students will utilize the knowledge gained during the semester to create specific proposals for preserving and enhancing the sustainability of US water and energy resources.",　,　,Undergraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,"6, 7",Environmental and Related Studies,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://www.coursicle.com/columbia/courses/SDEV/W4050/,2082

The course poses this question to a dozen leading sustainability practitioners, who answer it by discussing management strategies that they use in their own work. Through these guest lectures, extensive class discussion, readings, and writing assignments, students identify and simulate applying practical ways for transforming how organizations and complex systems work. The practitioners, who work in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors and in a wide variety of organizations, make presentations in the first hour of the course. Students then have time to ask questions and speak informally with the guest practitioners, and will participate in an instructor-led class discussion, geared toward identifying management strategies, better understanding their application, and considering their effectiveness. By the end of the course, the students gain an understanding of management tools and strategies that they, themselves, would use to integrate sustainability in organizations.

However, there will also be plenty of moments to think about the dynamics and personalities of families, CEOs, and directors.

There are a variety of perspectives from which questions of corporate governance can be formulated and addressed but it has been economic analysis that has largely dominated contemporary discussions of the subject. Most theories of governance are preoccupied with the relationship between institutions of governance and economic performance.

B8748-001Doing Business in Emerging Markets,"The global economy is no longer driven solely by the United States. Technological innovations have dramatically lowered the cost of doing business globally. Economic policies have steadily liberalized economies over the past two decades enabling firms to expand beyond their home market to seek global market opportunities, to achieve economies of scale and to leverage cost advantages. The Earth’s economic center of gravity is shifting towards Asia.
Yet despite the opportunities from globalization, most companies do not expand internationally. Of the small set of companies that do, most conduct business in markets that are very similar to their domestic market. Doubling the distance of a foreign market from the home market reduces trade by half. Even today, U.S. exports to Colombia are twice that of Indonesia, a fast growing country with a population five times that of Colombia. In short, many companies are ill-positioned to take advantage of global opportunities.
What are the costs of foreign expansion, and how can companies successfully leverage these costs to expand their presence abroad? How can companies avoid the common mistakes when venturing abroad? How should companies set pricing strategies to manage volatile swings in exchange rate movements? How should companies deal with corruption and weak enforcement of intellectual property? Managers that understand these challenges will be better positioned to take advantage of global opportunities and avoid ex post regret from failed ventures.
Many of the cases and examples in this class are drawn from emerging markets. These countries are growing very rapidly, and they also have substantially different business environments from Western countries. In addition to analyzing how companies deal with particular frictions in these economies, we will also take a more holistic perspective to understand why business practices in these markets look very different from the West.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2014,8,Business and Management,Wholesale and retail trade,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2014/spring/b8748-001,2090

B8559-001Social Entrepreneurship: Global Perspective,"This course introduces students to social entrepreneurs and their organizations around the world. What do these individuals and their organizations have in common, no matter where they are spawned? How does context influence the problems they choose to address, the organizational and business models they decide to pursue, and their growth options? When and how do they pursue partnerships with one another and with the business or public sectors, and what are the outcomes of such partnerships?",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2015,8,Business and Management,Professional services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2015/fall/b8559-001,2092

How do we define what constitutes “social impact” with respect to real estate projects? What are the financial building blocks and sources of capital available for developers and investors to utilize when putting together deals?  

Using examples of real deals, and focusing largely on U.S. urban markets, students will work through the challenges and opportunities of financing various types of projects, including: affordable and mixed-income housing, mixed-use, neighborhood retail, community facilities.  Students will be exposed to a variety of financial tools (LIHTCs, tax-exempt bonds, NMTCs, etc.) and public sector programs that are necessary to make social impact projects feasible while also being asked to gauge whether the risk-adjusted returns warrant “doing the deal”.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2020,"8, 11",Humanities and Law,Rental hiring and real estate services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2020/spring/b8428-001,2094
B8363-001Climate Finance,"This course will explore the science of climate change and its related economic and environmental impacts, and carefully examine the financial tools and techniques that can be applied to combat climate change in the context of evolving global policy.

B8349-001Finance and Sustainability,"Finance & Sustainability provides a high level introduction to the financial tools that can be used to address sustainability across a broad range of issues, including environmental (eg biodiversity, climate change) and social challenges (eg poverty, education, housing). By design, this course does not provide a deep dive on any specific issue. This course is suitable for both MBA students planning a career in financial services who want to understand the potential impact of their work on issues of sustainability, and for students planning a career in social enterprise who want to understand the application of financial tools. Specifically, the course objectives are to:

Understand the relationship between finance and sustainability.
Analyze which financial tools are effective (as measured by both sustainable impact and the ability to earn a financial return), and which are not.
Learn how the effective implementation of finance to address sustainability can be practically applied in a variety of contexts.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2016,8,Business and Management,Financial and insurance services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2016/fall/b8349-001,2096
B8219-001New Developments in Energy Markets,"The energy industry is one of the largest in the U.S., and is central to the operation of the economy. Currently it is undergoing rapid and possibly dramatic changes. Those changes and the factors driving them are the subject of this course.

The course starts with an analysis of the factors driving changes in energy markets – the rise in oil prices, geopolitical and energy security concerns, and climate change and the need to decarbonize the economy. This introductory section will also review the regulatory framework of the energy industry.

The next section of the course will focus on specific energy types and their economic and commercial characteristics. These will include solar thermal, solar PV, biofuels of various types, geothermal, wind, tidal, nuclear and then the use of energy in transportation (hybrid vehicles, hydrogen vehicles, electric vehicles). For each of these energy types we will talk about its general characteristics and then profile a company developing this energy type.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2017,"7, 13",Humanities and Law,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2017/fall/b8219-001,2097
B8573-001Global Philanthropy,"Global philanthropy has become a significant force in recent years, including both funding from developed countries to create change in the developing world as well as the growth of philanthropy in the developing world. The funds available for global philanthropy, forecasts for its future, media attention, levels of involvement, innovative approaches, expectations, and potential – all have grown and changed tremendously in recent years. Importantly, a global culture of philanthropy has begun emerging. Thus, it’s important for any business school student to understand how innovations in philanthropy around the world are having an impact on social, economic and environmental developments.

With this growth has come a set of important questions and challenges that this course will explore:
* Given its small size compared with the for-profit and public sectors, can private philanthropy make a difference?
* What gives private philanthropy its ""license to operate,"" and should it be seeking to change government policy?
* How can success in tackling complex challenges and systems be defined and measured?
* Do traditional models of giving actually work? Have newer models proved themselves?
* What is the best path for philanthropy in developing/emerging markets?

Using research, case studies and expert guests, this class will review current issues and approaches to important issues in global philanthropy, including education, livelihoods, public health and human rights. This class is intended to give MBA students the tools they need to assess opportunities and solutions as well as to become thoughtful, effective philanthropists. Specifically, students will learn to:
1. Analyze complex challenges in the developing world;
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of current programs to address these challenges;
3. Develop strategic options; and
4. Create a plan for funding and assessing results.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2018,"2, 3, 4, 5, 10",Humanities and Law,Professional services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2018/spring/b8573-001,2098
B8545-001High Performing Nonprofits,"The nonprofit sector is full of organizations, many of which are operating below peak performance. With unlimited ideas, low barriers to entry and decidedly limited funding, we have a sector with enormous volume and an overall lack of effectiveness. While the overall problem definition is accurate, well trod and unlikely to change, there are worthwhile remedies. The goal of the course is to study the solutions that work. We start by exploring all of the external and internal forces that cause weakness in nonprofit strategy and execution. Then we determine what factors can lead to high performance. We’ll review case studies and other real world examples to learn how the best nonprofits surmount significant barriers to produce great results.

The course is six sessions. The first three sessions focus on the nonprofit operating environment and the central strategic issues facing nonprofits today. The next two sessions deal with finances – the over-emphasized keys to smart revenue generation and the under-emphasized importance of effective spending. The last session rivets on talent – both at the board level as well as senior staff – and how you should think about crafting a path with high impact both during and after your business education. As a newly minted MBA, your skill set will be in high demand in the sector. That said, the direct application of for profit strategies to nonprofit work has limits. We’ll look at where and how to take the best of private thinking, adjust it and apply it to nonprofit performance. We’ll question many commonly held assumptions on the sector. The course will touch on theory, but will be grounded in current practice.

Whether you have past experience, current involvement or future aspirations, you should take this course if you’re interested in pushing changes as an: 1.) institutional or individual donor; 2.) board member; 3.) executive director or senior leader; or 4.) management consultant. The goal is to give you the knowledge and skills to work from either inside or outside to drive nonprofits to achieve.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2020,8,Business and Management,Professional services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2020/spring/b8545-001,2099
B8544-001The Nonprofit Sector & The City,"There are many forces that keep cities vibrant and livable. There are two forces that are clearly visible and acknowledged – government and commerce – for the good that they generate and provide. But there is another force that is not so readily acknowledged, and yet, plays a key role in ensuring that a city not only functions but is a strong community of service, health, education, and culture. It is the nonprofit sector that supports this latter work. In New York City, nonprofits have had a long history of activity and action. Currently, there are 15,000 nonprofits in Metro New York – and over 1,500,000 in the U.S that account for than $1 trillion in revenues annually. The nonprofit sector is now the third largest industry in the country and bigger than construction, banking and telecommunications. Indeed, some of the largest employers in New York City are nonprofits: Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, and Columbia University.

Much is expected of the third sector – especially in urban communities. Not only to simply provide shelter for the night for the homeless, but also to tackle more complex issues such as public education reform, developing green jobs, and rethinking and reforming the juvenile justice system. But why does this matter? Because according to Robin Hood Foundation, New York City has 1.9 million adults and children living in poverty. And fair or unfair, nonprofits have been asked to try and fill the growing chasm between the haves and have-nots. In addition, the third sector is called on to tackle issues that government cannot address or is not willing to address and usually do it with fewer resources. This is quite a challenge, and some say it's impossible; the challenge is far too steep. Others argue that this country’s nonprofits are dynamic and resilient and can indeed meet the challenge – by being deeply connected to the communities they serve and being nimble enough to provide the services that are truly needed and demonstrate impact.

Some questions for the class to consider:
* Is the third sector a viable answer – a panacea – to many of the problems that hinder urban communities?
* What would real public-private-nonprofit partnerships that can provide various services to the less fortunate look like?
* What tools, tactics, and strategies does a professional working in the nonprofit sector need to succeed?
* Is there enough capital in the nonprofit sector – public, private or philanthropic -- to go around? Where is it going? Why is it going there?

This class explores this energetic sector and its impact on urban communities. While much can be learned and gained from reading and reviewing various books, articles, and websites, the instructor not only believes in bringing the class into the community to see an important project but also to meet and engage with the leaders behind these efforts. This is a class that bridges theory and practice. Both inform each other. We are deeply fortunate that New York City provides such a full array of leaders, organizations and programs that are concerned with tackling and solving issues and problems that confront us as a community.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,"8, 11",Business and Management,Professional services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2022/spring/b8544-001,2100
B8527-001Social Venture Incubator,"This course is an incubator for startups making a tangible impact on people or the planet. The spirit of the course is to foster cross-campus access and collaboration to leverage Columbia talent and resources to build your team, access any necessary technology, advance your venture, and gain investor interest.

This course is an application only, 6-week (1.5 credits) structured experiential course offered to MBAs and interested students across Columbia University’s schools. Students will build new or advance existing social, environmental, health, and other impact ventures through collaborative investigation, experimentation, iterative design, network building, and compelling presentations to interested stakeholders. Potential ventures are mission driven, financially sustainable, and may span a broad range of sectors. Note that ventures may be structured as for-profit, a hybrid for-profit/nonprofit enterprise, or be a uniquely innovative nonprofit.

This incubator emphasizes the ""double"" or ""triple bottom line"" (achieving social and environmental impacts along with a financial return), encourages students to seek large market opportunities, and sets the expectation to materially leverage Columbia’s cross-campus talent and resources. Lean Launchpad and Design Thinking techniques will be used. Each session will consist of team presentations, lessons, inter-team collaboration, and mentoring.

Student teams finish the course with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP, no coding required), a validation-driven business model, preliminary pro formas (with data room), an investor ready pitch deck, demo day experience, and a one-page investment circular for introductions.","Build skill sets to launch a venture addressing problems affecting people and planet.

B8448-001The Business of Climate Change: Investing and Manageing in a Changing Environement,"This course will provide a framework for thinking about climate change and its consequences for business. The perspective taken will be that of senior executives or CEOs in industries affected by climate change. The course is intended for students who are interested in consulting careers, who are likely to encounter these issues as they move between companies and industries. It is also relevant for students interested in corporate strategy, which in many cases will be affected by the issues in the course. And for students going into fund management, who will need to think about the challenges that climate will pose for the firms that they invest in and to analyze which companies will be well-placed to cope with these. The course is also relevant for students interested in impact investing, green investing/SRI, and careers that have a direct relationship to environmental issues. It will also be of relevance to those seeking careers in the investment, consulting, or even general management area, where there will be issues relative to a firm’s or investor's social-responsibility, or to project choice in the face of environmental impacts, that even mid-level managers will have to worry about.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2019,"8, 13",Business and Management,Financial and insurance services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2019/spring/b8448-001,2103
B8423-001Investor Influence on Corporate Sustainability,"Should investors care about the social impact of the companies in their portfolios? Can a company’s relationship with society impact its investment performance? Should investors try to shape corporate behavior or just sell shares if they disagree with management? How do shareholders use their voice to influence corporate policy? How do corporations respond? What are the possibilities and limitations of shareholder influence? Does it matter?

As fractional owners of companies, shareholders possess the right to influence corporate policies on environmental and social concerns. Following a decade of corporate scandal, financial crisis, and increasing concern about climate change and globalization, interest in using these powers is growing beyond the small community of religious and socially conscious investors who have traditionally raised these concerns with corporations.

By 2012, over 900 institutional investors with assets of over $30 trillion had endorsed the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI). Signatories to the UNPRI pledge to be “active owners,” engaged directly in the governance of the companies in which they invest. In response, nearly 6000 companies worldwide now publicly report on their social responsibility policies and practices.

This course will explore emerging questions regarding corporate social responsibility from the perspective of the investor in public equities. Students will learn how investors engage directly with corporate boards and management to address sustainability concerns and improve long-term performance.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2014,8,Business and Management,Financial and insurance services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2014/spring/b8423-001,2104

B8214-001Business in Society: Doing Well by Doing Good?,"Can a business be a financial success and also be valuable to society? Is there a conflict between looking after shareholders and looking after stakeholders more generally? Is it ethical to outsource production to low-wage countries where working conditions are vastly inferior to those in the US?

These are topical and pressing issues, of concern to most corporations and to many in the political and Non-Governmental worlds. They are also the main focus of “Business and Society.” It is an interactive discussion-based and case-based course that looks at examples of companies that have succeeded in doing well (financially) and doing good (for society). We also hear from practitioners who are wrestling with these issues in their business lives, ranging from executives of large corporations and non-profits to CEOs of start-ups focusing on the social venture space.

The picture that emerges from the course is that “doing well” (financially) and “doing good” (for society and stakeholders) can be made compatible. There are many examples of companies that do both – that meet demanding ethical standards and add immense value for all stakeholders, while being amongst the most profitable in their industries and giving a great return to investors . In the course we try to understand why this is, and what distinguishes these companies from others. When are these two goals compatible, and how can a company go about reconciling them?",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2014,8,Business and Management,Professional services,https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2014/fall/b8214-001,2108
B8224-001Energy and Resource Economics,"Energy and Natural Resources including water, food, and materials form the most basic and vital inputs to our economy. Without easy access to these inputs the level of global income we currently enjoy would be impossible. Energy, industry’s prime mover, and its related delivery architectures are vital to producing the wealth and welfare of modern society. However the energy sector is not only constrained by its own system dynamics, but by linkages to other resource sectors like water, food, and materials.

Economics is the study of scarcity, and understanding how individuals and businesses optimize their processes and production in the face of limits informs everything in business from budgeting to investment to forecasting. Using a theoretical and practical understanding of the process by which energy technologies are developed, financed, and deployed, this course seeks to highlight the root drivers for change in the energy and natural resource industries, the technologies that are emerging, and the factors that will determine success in their commercialization.

Doing so requires the development of a set of economic and market analysis tools that will allow a rigorous analytic understanding of what is going on in these markets, how buyers and sellers think about market interaction, and the trajectories and occasional dislocations that occur.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2015,8,Humanities and Law,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/courses/mba/2015/spring/b8224-001,2109

L8615Nonprofit Law and Policy,"Nonprofits play a critical role in U.S. society, as well as across the globe. If the U.S. nonprofit sector was a country, it would have the eight largest economy in the world. Nonprofits offer an alternative mechanism, independent of governments, to advance public goals. This course explores a range of legal and policy issues about nonprofits, focusing on their treatment under U.S. law. What are the different types of nonprofits under U.S. law, and how do they differ from each other? What makes them different from for-profit firms, and thus better suited to the private pursuit of public goals? Unlike for-profit firms, nonprofits do not exist to make a profit, but to advance a cause. As a result, how should nonprofits allocate scarce resources without relying on the metric of profitability? More generally, what are the key governance and management challenges that arise in nonprofits and how should they be addressed? What is the role of different stakeholders within nonprofits, including the board, donors, managers, and beneficiaries? What are their sources of legal authority (if any)? What government institutions within the US are responsible for regulating nonprofits? Although government regulation of nonprofits is limited, government funding can be quite significant. Nonprofits receive government financial support from both grants and tax subsidies. Is this funding justified? Is the goal to encourage innovation and to fund ideas that are too controversial or unproven to be implemented by government institutions, which are designed to favor the preferences of the median voter? Or is the goal to rely on donors with ""skin in the game"" to monitor a nonprofit's performance? Or is the goal to separate the government from sectors, such as religious institutions and the press, which should not be subject to government influence? Or another goal? Are the subsidies structured in ways that are likely to advance the relevant goals? What key tax issues arise for nonprofits and their donors? What are the relevant rules supposed to accomplish and how successful are they in achieving these goals? Classes are organized with problem sheets, which pose questions and offer hypotheticals. Students do not have to hand in these problem sets, but should use them to prepare for class. Class participation is factored into the final grade.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2021,"8, 16",Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://www.law.columbia.edu/academics/courses/26846,2131
L8451Advanced Climate Change Law,"This seminar examines cutting-edge U.S. and international issues in the regulation of climate change.

Most of the course concerns U.S. law but a consiberable amount of international law is studied as well. It begins with an overview of the causes and effects of global climate change and the methods available to control and adopt to it. We will then examine the negotiation, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, its Kyoto Protocol, and efforts to create a successor agreement. The focus will then turn to the past and proposed actions of the U.S. Congress, the executive branch and the courts, as well as regional, state and municipal efforts. The Clean Air Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and relevant energy laws will receive special attention. We will evaluate the various legal tools that are available to address climate change, including cap-and-trade schemes; carbon taxation; command-and-control regulation; litigation; information disclosure; and voluntary action. Implications for international human rights, energy security, economic competitiveness, federalism, environmental justice, and international and intergenerational equity will be discussed.

L8454Extraction Industry and Sustainable Dev,"As the world intensifies efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, we will see a massive deployment of renewable energy generation, distribution and storage, electric vehicles, and mobile platforms for telehealth and remote education, among a proliferation of new technologies for our carbon-neutral and increasingly digitized future. This leap to the future will increase demand for minerals and metals, and require a rapid phase-out of coal, oil, and gas. This transition presents both tremendous opportunities and overwhelming challenges, especially but not only for countries dependent on these resources for their economic development. Extractive industries have always been at the heart of the sustainable development challenge. Investments in natural resources have the potential to catalyze sustainable development, through taxes and royalties, local procurement or processing, expanded access to infrastructure, capacity building, industrialization, and so on. Yet rather than serving as a springboard to development, investment in extractive industries have often been a source of corruption, social degradation, conflict with local communities, and environmental catastrophe. The Decade of Action brings a clarion call to extractive industry actors, and those who support, finance, and govern them. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, averting cataclysmic climate and other environmental crises, protecting the rights and interests of local communities, and meeting the material and technological needs of our growing population depend on how our global natural resources are managed and governed.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2021,"3, 9, 13",Humanities and Law,Mining,https://www.law.columbia.edu/academics/courses/29788,2134

Students will be confronted with environmental problems brought to them by clients and work together with the client, their colleagues, and the professor to identify strategies for seeking innovative solutions for the clients' concerns. Students will engage in a variety of fact gathering and fact development techniques including interviewing clients, file reviews and reviews of other documentary sources, Freedom of Information Act/Law requests, pre-trial discovery, and preparation of experts and other witnesses. Students will explore and pursue both litigation and non-litigation strategies for resolving the clients' problems. Students will work with professionals from other disciplines to seek creative solutions for their clients' concerns. Other professionals who may be involved in the work of the clinic include planners, biologists, environmental scientists, engineers, and economists. In devising strategies to alleviate the clients' concerns, students will develop and refine counseling skills. Students will address ethical issues arising from their cases including potential conflicts that may arise in the representation of multiple clients. Students will learn the professional obligations that they have as lawyers in the attorney-client relationship.

We will hold a weekly seminar to discuss work on cases, explore legal and ethical issues that arise in cases, and engage in the simulation exercises. To prepare for their work as lawyers representing clients, students will participate in an extensive program of simulations including client interviewing, investigation, drafting of pleadings, arguing motions, drafting interrogatories and responses, depositions, negotiations, and trial practice.

Students will identify their own professional goals for the semester including specific skills or professional attributes they would like to develop or enhance in preparation for making the transition to the legal profession.

By 2050 there may well be 9 billion people and global GDP of more than US$250 trillion. The challenges of governance for sustainable development in a globalizing world are real and many, with growing demands for participation in decision making in every country. National governments must coordinate policy development and implementation with diverse actors -- businesses, local governments, regional / international institutions, and civil society organizations. The world urgently needs the practice of sustainable development to address the simultaneous challenges of ending poverty, increasing social inclusion, and sustaining local and planetary life systems. Leaders of 193 countries adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the UN Sustainable Development Summit on September 25, 2015. The challenges of adopting the sustainable development agenda are many. Feasible pathways to long-term sustainability are complex, subject to technological and political uncertainties, and requiring substantial resources. Sound policy-making and effective execution in each country requires a long-term approach that integrates strategies vis-à-vis many development challenges, including institutional, financial, social and environmental.

The focus is on those extremes that have historically proven to have the greatest consequences - earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and droughts. We then describe the social phenomenology especially the macroeconomic consequences of disasters.  Here we are in relatively new territory and we will call on analogies with well-established economic shocks such as currency slums and financial crises to explain how disaster shocks might differentially impact societies at varying development levels. We then discuss how the UN and other international agencies deal with disasters.

SDEV W2300Challenges of Sustainable Development,"This course provides an introduction to the field of sustainable development, drawing primarily from social science and policy studies. It offers a critical examination of the concept of sustainable development, showing how factors like economics, population, culture, politics and inequality complicate its goals. Students will learn how different social science disciplines (political science, demography, economics, geography, history, law, and sociology) approach challenges of sustainable development across a variety of topics (fisheries, climate change, air pollution, consumption, energy, conservation, and water management). The course provides students with some of the fundamental concepts, vocabulary, and analytical tools to pursue and think critically about sustainable development.

SDEV W2320Economic and Financial Methods for Sustainable Development,"Principles of Economics and one semester of calculus. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the skills and methods necessary to understand and evaluate the economic and financial aspects of sustainable development. Throughout the course, students will compare competing objectives and policies through the prism of economic & financial reasoning. Environmental economics and finance are broad areas covering all the multi-faceted and complex interactions between the economic system and the natural environment. Financial markets are the primary source of signals used to direct economic activity in a capitalist global economy. Economic activity is the primary determinant of the quality and sustainability of the natural environment. Students interested in sustainable development who are unfamiliar with economics and who do not develop a facility with economic and financial concepts are severely handicapped in their efforts to increase the level of environmental responsibility embedded in economic activity. This course is intended to provide students with a flying introduction to key analytical concepts required to understand topics in environmental economics and finance and to introduce them to selected topics within the field. The first part of the course (the Analytical Toolbox) is designed to provide a set of portable skills for two sets of students: a) those who will work in fields specifically devoted to sustainable development who, as part of their work, will need to engage with sources of economic & financial information and with discourses where sustainable development is not a focus; and b) students who may end up following careers in organizations where sustainability is not the primary objective. The topics and readings in the second part of the course were chosen to facilitate a critical engagement with the broad intellectual framework underlying sustainable development from the perspective of economics and finance. The topics are intended to create a community of intellectual discourse on sustainable development that will spill over beyond the classroom to the conversations of students and alumni that will far outlive graduation.

ENVP U6320Political Context of Public/Private Environmental Management ,"Many of the decisions we make and actions we take have profound environmental effects, yet economic and political considerations often dominate decision-making in a way that fails to take into account the environmental foundation of our livelihoods. A slow, yet steady extension of environmental imperatives into previously ânonâ environmental sectors such as agriculture, trade and energy production, provide some movement towards sustainability. This class explores how the political system identifies public issues as problems requiring public action, and creates and implements policy solutions. It assesses what conditions foster change by anticipating likely outcomes and effective points of intervention to achieve policy goals. It emphasizes the politics of environmental policymaking, using energy, agriculture and forestry as cases of global enterprises with local to global scales of inquiry. We will explore the tension between the market and economic models and politics and political models of policymaking; interests and interest-group politics; the connections among expertise, knowledge, and policymaking; and the particular politics of policy issues that cross jurisdictional boundaries, including federalism and globalization. We will start the semester considering two contrasting theories of policymaking: an economic, market-based approach with application in environmental policy issues and a political approach. The latter constitutes a critique of the economic paradigm and sets up the tension between the concerns for policy efficiency and effectiveness stemming from the economic model, and those of equity, representation, and consensus derived from the political model. Participants will develop a sense of the history of environmental activism, relevant actors in environmental politics and management, their roles, sources of power and influence, the effects of formal political processes and the sources of potential conflicts.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2021,"14, 15, 16",Environmental and Related Studies,Public administration and safety,https://www.coursicle.com/columbia/#search=ENVP+U6320&semester=fall2021,2198

INAF U6040International Energy Project Finance,"Project finance is a capital-raising technique frequently employed to build or purchase energy assets that produce reliable cashflows.  The investment’s risks are mitigated through contracts with project counterparties; project capital is sourced among various investors: corporate sponsors, project developers, investment funds, commercial lenders, development banks, export credit agencies.  Projects related to the energy transition to lower-carbon or no-carbon power generation and the parallel expansion of global LNG markets are the most prominent examples of international energy project finance today. The course takes a case-study approach, reviewing these trends and drawing lessons through a survey of international project financings: electric generation both renewables and gas-fired, price-hedged and merchant, along with infrastructure projects linked to natural gas including LNG export/import. Government policies providing incentives for investment in renewables, for promotion of exports, or for monetizing energy resources are featured in this survey. The objective of the course is to provide students with a practical grounding for market participants or policy analysts to appreciate which types of energy projects can attract investors and lenders in current financial markets. The course employs financial modeling and credit risk-rating exercises for students to develop basic skills in identifying the principal project risks, performing cashflow analysis, and measuring the investment and credit metrics for equity and debt capital sources",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2021,8,Humanities and Law,"Electricity, gas, water and waste services",https://www.coursicle.com/columbia/#search=INAF+U6040&semester=fall2021,2204

"ENVP U6225Ethics, Values, and Justice","The purpose of this course is to examine the claims made by multiple stakeholders for use of the environment, both natural and built, and to determine how contention among them can be ethically resolved in the policy process. Over time, six major clusters of stakeholders have arisen, expressing environmentalist standpoints: three, including proponents of wilderness, ecosystems, and nonhuman species, have been called nonanthropocentric; and three, including proponents of conservation, environmental justice, and sustainability, have been called anthropocentric. Among them a diverse array of ethical quarrels has arisen, yet today the sustainability outlook appears to be ascendant in popular and public discourse. Claims made regarding greater or lesser use of both natural and human resources continue to be debated nonetheless. Many are related to the issues of whether present use should take into account past wrongful, often inter-racially prejudicial actions, and future-regarding, often inter-generationally beneficial actions. The course aims to examine specific principles, such as polluter pays for pollution, prior free informed consent, transboundary accountability, and common responsibility, which can be used to resolve ethical issues. Consideration is given to the possibility of both collective and individual ethical action, even in situations of corruption, including subtle forms involving campaign contributions with a pay-to-play aspect.

Students will be expected to understand, apply and critique micro-economic models that inform environmental policy. By the end of the semester, students will be expected to use economic concepts fluently to advocate various public policy positions. We will begin with the big picture; how did economics evolve, what is a capitalist economy, and how do we think about it. We will then focus on tools for understanding core institutions such markets, individual workers and consumers, and firms. We describe simple supply-demand relationships and apply these to economic problems. We introduce the concepts of opportunity cost and choice, which are fundamental to an economic framework for environmental policy. We then examine basic tools used by economists. We examine in detail the underlying theory of consumers and producers necessary to derive supply and demand relationships. This detailed analysis facilitates an intelligent application and critique of these basic economic tools.

ENVP U8216Economics for Environmental Policy II,"This is a core economics course for the MPA in Environmental Science and Policy. The course explores the use of the tools of economic analysis in the discussion and evaluation of environmental policies. It builds on the microeconomic framework developed in Microeconomics and Policy Analysis I and extends it in a few directions. First, we deepen the discussion of theoretical issues particularly relevant for the analysis of environmental policies, such as externalities and public goods. Second, we explore how the theoretical concepts covered can be measured and used in actual environmental policy, and discuss real world examples of such applications. And finally, we discuss some aggregate implications related to – and the available evidence on – the two-way relationship between natural resources and economic growth. The objective of the course is to provide students with the necessary background for an understanding of the logic underlying the economic perspective on environmental policies. This is important to develop the skills necessary to conceptualize the trade-offs implicit in such policy decisions and to give a glimpse of the tools available to evaluate such trade-offs. As a result, it also helps build knowledge useful in a critical reading of policy proposals and evaluations in the environmental field.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,8,Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://www.coursicle.com/columbia/#search=ENVP+U8216&semester=spring2022,2217
ENVP 6239Politics and Policy for Urban Sustainability,"This is a course for thoughtful people who wish to influence actual policy outcomes related to sustainability challenges in major cities. Its objective is not to provide a primer on urban sustainability solutions; this is readily available from textbooks and will change by the time you are in a position to act. Rather, the course’s objective is to prepare you for the kind of challenges that will face you as a policy practitioner in the field of urban sustainability. Cities are increasingly recognized as a key level of government for environmental and sustainability policy. As at all levels, politics and policy are intensely intertwined, and perhaps more so at the local level because the decisions involved often affect constituents directly and intimately --in their neighborhoods, in their homes, in their commutes. This reading-heavy colloquium explores the politics and the policy of urban sustainability from the perspective of someone who wishes to effect change. It culminates in a team project in which students act as a sustainability policy team in a mayoral (or equivalent) office in one of the world’s major cities. The course considers key components of the city itself, with the objective of understanding what shapes the city and its impact on the environment. It mainly uses case studies from the twentieth-century United States, paired with international readings to allow a comparison with other experiences. The focus on deep case studies allows the consideration of the situations, constraints, and political dynamics of specific situations. It is intended to provide students with the ability to recognize patterns in urban political and policy dynamics related to sustainability. These are paired with an overview of leading solutions and how the professor believes practitioners should evaluate them for their own cities. The course also prominently features in-class presentations and discussions of the students’ main project: a team-based memo making a specific recommendation to solve a problem in a specific major world city, which is presented twice, once for a diagnosis of the problem in a given city and a second time with a policy recommendation. This project is the major portion of the overall grade for the class, and is used to allow the students to wrestle with the challenge of turning ideas from past and present into successful urban sustainability policies that can get implemented in a political and institutional world. In order to cover issues in depth, this course is not exhaustive; several key issues are omitted here, and the challenges of cities of the Global South are not addressed systematically, but the course provides the background, awareness, and tools to address these problems as well.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,11,Humanities and Law,Public administration and safety,https://www.coursicle.com/columbia/courses/ENVP/U6239/,2218

P8317Frameworks for Environmental Health Policy,"How should society regulate environmental health risks? Some argue that the health of the citizenry is paramount, and that the role of government should be to protect against any possibility of harm. Others back an approach based on a full accounting of the benefits and costs of environmental protection. And in the current political environment, ideological positions sometimes eclipse analysis. These debates occur against a backdrop of uncertainty about the health risks posed by specific environmental insults. In spite of all this ambiguity and complexity, policy happens: congress makes laws, regulatory agencies enforce the law, and most polluters comply.

In this class we will study several frameworks for thinking about these questions. Environmental economics, in the form of benefit-cost analyses, is the primary framing used by the US Federal Government. We will explore its conceptual foundations and its applications in the US regulatory context. In our discussions of the sociology of science perspective, we will examine how environmental health scientists interact with the policy process, and think through how such interactions might be improved. The third perspective is decision theory, and in particular, choice under uncertainty. We will consider the basic analytics of expected value, and some permutations and applications that are germane to the environmental health policy domain. In addition to these conceptual frameworks, we will analyze and interpret cases drawn from recent experiences with environmental health regulation in the United States.

This course is designed to introduce Mailman students to core frameworks for thinking about environmental health policy. The course is open to all students.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,"3, 8, 16",Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2236

P8319Biological Markers of Chemical Exposure,"To evaluate the impact of environmental exposures on human diseases, several pieces of information are needed. The specific chemicals to which people are exposed, the level of exposure and the toxicity of the chemicals must all be known. While some information on exposure can be obtained by measuring levels of the chemicals of interest in air, food, water, etc., the use of biomarkers of exposure can provide information much more relevant to understanding risk. This course will cover the types of biospecimens collected from humans, how they are processed and the types of assays that are carried out. A major focus is exposure to genotoxic chemicals and the measurable effects they produce but chemicals that produce other types of toxicity are also covered. The course goals are to understand the analytic methodology, its appropriate use, how quantitative data are obtained and the limitations of that data. Methods for analysis of genotype, expression of microRNAs and other genes, DNA methylation, histone modifications and microbiomes are also covered. Biomarkers can also be used for early disease diagnosis, collection of information on disease etiology, as intermediate endpoints in intervention studies and for the selection of optimal treatments. Students will learn how biomarkers are being incorporated into modern epidemiological research.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,"3, 9",Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2238
P8325Risk Assessment & Communication,"Risk Assessment is the process of correlating the amount of exposure (to a chemical, activity, or situation) with expected harm. This Department core course is primarily concerned with toxic substances to which humans are exposed through their environments, in the context of whether and how exposure to such toxicants should be controlled: risk assessment. Toxicological and epidemiological principles are used primarily to provide (uncertain) quantitative estimates of the harm associated with a given level of exposure: dose-response. Using a dose-response relationship necessitates quantifying exposure, an uncertain endeavor that relies on understanding human physiology and behavior. The quantitative estimates of harm from anthropogenic activity that risk assessment gives are just the starting point for the challenge of risk management: ""What do we do now?"" The resulting decisions are influenced by both economic factors (e.g., cost-benefit analysis) and psychological factors (e.g., risk perception).",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,3,Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2239

These include a briefing of subject matter experts, a site investigation plan for a town council, a PPT presentation to the executive board of a non-profit organization, a review of a superfund site for a state public health agency, and a factsheet for the general public.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,3,Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2240
P8406Infectious Disease Epidemiology,"Infectious disease epidemiology monitors the occurrence of infectious diseases and develops strategies for preventing and controlling disease. It requires the use of traditional epidemiologic methods as well as methods that cannot be applied to non-infectious diseases, such as mathematical modeling. In addition to knowing epidemiologic methods, infectious disease epidemiologists need to be familiar with the clinical and biological features of important infectious diseases as well as laboratory techniques for the identification and quantification of infectious agents. This course is designed to provide an introduction to infectious disease epidemiology. It will focus on the tools and methods used in identifying, preventing, and controlling infectious diseases to improve public health. Case studies based on the literature and the work of faculty members will be used to illustrate the real-world application of these tools and methods to address public health problems.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,3,Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2241
P8430Public Health Surveillance,"Public health surveillance is the fundamental mechanism that public health agencies use to monitor the health of the communities they serve. It is a core function of public health practice, and its purpose is to provide a factual basis from which agencies can appropriately set priorities, plan programs, and take actions to promote and protect the public's health.

P8469Epidemiology of Malaria ,"Malaria imposes a profound burden on public health and inhibits economic growth. It is distributed over 90 countries accounting for an annual estimate of 400 million cases and over one million deaths, most of them in children. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to malaria, resulting in infection, miscarriages, severe anemia, maternal mortality and low birth weight. Low birth weight poses the greatest risk for neonatal death. The disease also affects non-immune immigrants, refugees and displaced populations during their movement from non-endemic to endemic areas. Resistance to anti-malarial drugs and insecticides by the Plasmodium human parasites and Anopheles vector mosquitoes respectively is widespread.

P8471Social Epidemiology,"This course focuses on the branch of epidemiology concerned with how social arrangements, processes, and interactions shape the population distribution of health and disease and produce social inequalities in health. The sub-discipline of social epidemiology has grown dramatically in the past decade and, while still evolving as an interdisciplinary enterprise, it is now an established field of etiologic inquiry, both incorporating and influencing the conventional theories, methods, and principles of epidemiology. This course will familiarize students with the key theories, concepts, methods, findings, and ongoing debates in social epidemiology. Through lectures, readings, and discussion we will review the major social determinants of health, the theories and empirical evidence with respect to how social conditions “get under the skin,” and the methodological challenges involved in measuring social phenomena and making causal inferences about the relationship between social factors and health. By the end of the course students will understand the theoretical, substantive, and methodological parameters of this growing sub-discipline of epidemiologic inquiry, and be able to evaluate both its strengths and limitations.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,3,Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2246

P8544Environmental Health Economics,"The primary goal of environmental regulation is to protect human health, but there are a wide range of options available to policy makers and considerable disagreement over how to best implement regulation. This class focuses on understanding environmental health policy from an economic perspective. After reviewing basic economic concepts relevant for this course, we discuss an economic viewpoint of environmental issues, including when and how to intervene with markets. Since all environmental regulation requires knowledge of the threats posed by environmental exposure, we then focus on measuring the health benefits from environmental policies, recognizing we omit several important non-health benefits. We also briefly discuss the costs posed to society from environmental regulation, an important component of regulatory impact analysis often required by federal rules. We discuss the main approaches to environmental policy in the US, including incentive based approaches, such as tradeable discharge permits, emission taxes and subsidies, and voluntary programs, and the more traditional ‘command and control’ approach. After highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, we apply these concepts to current environmental policy on such topics as air quality, toxic and hazardous waste, climate change, and ozone depletion.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,"3, 13, 16",Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2249
P8588Health Disparities and Public Policy,"It isn’t surprising is that, in the US, people that live in lousy housing, have limited access to health care, and work in risky jobs live unhealthy lives and die prematurely. But can providing a robust welfare state really more than make up the difference? We can be relatively certain that the chain smoking, alcohol drinking French and Japanese do not have a healthier lifestyle. So why is it that the French and Japanese so dramatically outlive white, native-born Americans?

Health disparities are differences in the burden of disease between communities or socio-demographically defined groups of people. They can arise as a result of limitations in access to medical care or other social resources, but might also arise from perceptions (e.g. discrimination or a sense of being treated unfairly) or other daily stressors. Though socioeconomic disparities were recognized in the ancient medical writings of both Eastern and Western civilizations, remarkably little is known about why disparities lead to morbidity and mortality. More importantly, little is known about which policies work best to reverse the impact of disparities on health and civil society.

Unlike a class in the socio-medical sciences, this class focuses primarily focuses on the policy implications of socio-economic disparities. From a policy perspective, solutions must be causally linked not only with reductions in poverty (or increases in education), but also to improvements in health. Taking this one step further, they must also be cost-effective to be worthwhile. We ask whether it is more cost-effective to address disparities in access to care, or to treat some of the underlying causes of these disparities with policies that address education quality, income distribution, market regulations, disability insurance, and other forms of social insurance.",　,　,Postgraduate course,United States,Columbia University,2022,"1, 3, 11",Health,Health care and social assistance,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/course-directory,2250

Modelling Nature-Positive Land Management: Lessons from the East of England Landscape Enterprise Network (LENS) ,"This report takes readers step by step through the LENS1 East of England project that links management and investment in landscapes to the long-term needs of business and society, ending with lessons learned and a look ahead. It provides a guide for public and private sector organisations around the country looking for ways to mitigate risks from the degradation of natural resources on which they rely. For policymakers and regulators, it illustrates an effective, scalable approach to help deliver on the Government’s 25-year Environment Plan and its commitments to address the climate and biodiversity crises.

The report explains how University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) and 3Keel, acting as facilitators, used the LENS model to bring together disparate key players and overcome two common barriers to effective landscape interventions:

how to deploy funding from multiple disparate private and public sector parties seeking different outcomes in an efficient, equitable and accountable way
how to create a governance structure that provides all stakeholders, including farmers, with the agency, confidence and trust to unlock funding and manage vested interests.
Initial funding partners included Anglian Water, Cereal Partners UK, Essex and Suffolk Water, Nestle Purina and Northampton County Council. These have since been joined by Affinity Water and Cargill, with £2.4m raised for the second project round launched in spring 2022 with 71 farmers taking part. The scheme's rapid growth reflected farmer interest and ambition, and the additional partners which enabled a doubling of budget and a 250% increase in scale, covering more than 250,000 hectares. The scheme will continue at least until 2027 and up to 120 farmers are expected in 2023.

Modelling Nature-Positive Agriculture: Lessons in farmer-led nutrient management from Poole Harbour,"This report takes readers step by step through The Poole Harbour Nutrient Management Scheme (PHNMS), a new approach designed to curbing farm nutrient losses and achieve cleaner waters on protected coastlines, in order to prevent a potential Water Protection Zone and further regulation in the Poole Harbour catchment. The report ends with lessons learned and a look ahead.

The ground-breaking PHNMS in Dorset is a leading example of potentially transformative nature-based solutions. Backed by the National Famers Union (NFU) and local councils, and managed by Poole Harbour Agriculture Group (PHAG), a farmer collective, PHNMS will be run as an Environment Agency 'approved scheme’. Whilst its primary goal is to reduce nitrate runoff from farms, it has the potential to deliver co-benefits for sustainable, productive agriculture, biodiversity, and carbon and climate goals. PHAG, partner and other catchment stakeholders are to meet the following objectives:

Provide a framework for delivering nutrient reductions into Poole Harbour from the agriculture sector whilst enabling offsetting by other sectors, including water companies and developers.
Influence the development of an effective Nutrient Accounting Tool that farmers can use to account for nutrient losses to the environment.
Enable the trading of nutrient allocations between farms.

","In the contemporary world, different systems of knowledge, philosophies, and techniques of the self, understandings of normality and pathology, illness and healing, are increasingly engaged in a dialogue with each other in the lives, on the bodies, and in the imagination of people. The terms of this dialogue are often unequal and painful, yet they are also productive of new subjectivities and new voices. It is the task of a renewed psychological anthropology to study and reflect on these processes. Topics to be covered in this class include new forms of the subject and ethics at the intersection of psychical/psychiatric, political, and religious processes and discources; ethno-psychiatry, psychoanalysis, the psychology of colonization and racism; anthropological approaches to possession and altered states, emotion, culture, and the imagination, madness and mental illness.

"Architecture 212: Body-Conscious Design: Shoes, Chairs, Rooms, and Beyond","This seminar prepares students to evaluate and design environments from the point of view of how they interact with the human body. Tools and clothing modify that interaction. Semi-fixed features of the near environment, especially furniture, may have greater impact on physical well being and social-psychological comfort than fixed features like walls, openings, and volume. Today, designers can help redefine and legitimize new attitudes toward supporting the human body by, for example, designing for a wide range of postural alternatives and possibly designing new kinds of furniture. At the urban design scale, the senses of proprioception and kinesthetics can be used to shape architecture and landscape architecture. This course covers these topics with special emphasis on chair design and evaluation. The public health implications of a new attitude toward posture and back support are explored. The course heightens students' consciousness of their own and others' physical perceptions through weekly experiential exercises. Students produce three design exercises: shoe, chair, and a room interior.",,,Postgraduate course,United States,University of California; Berkeley,2021,"3,11",Architecture and Building,Construction,"http://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/a,resec/",2331

Architecture 238: The Dialectic of Poetics and Technology,"This seminar examines the relationship between technology and design philosophy in the work of architects through analysis of individual buildings within the context of the complete oeuvre and an examination of the architect's writings and lectures. The seminar poses the following questions: What is the role of technology in the design philosophy of the architect and how is this theoretical position established in the architect's writings, lectures, interviews? How is this position revealed through the work moves to the developing world? How is this position negotiated in the design and construction of an individual building? Is this a successful strategy for achieving technical performance? Is this a successful strategy for achieving a coherent theoretical statement? A series of lectures explores these questions in relation to the architect and a set of required readings introduces the work of the architect and explores the relationship between technology and design philosophy. Students choose one building to investigate in parallel with the methods and issues discussed in class. These studies are presented in class as completed and assembled for submission as a final project.",,,Postgraduate course,United States,University of California; Berkeley,2018,11,"Architecture and Building
